| **Advantages**                                     | **Disadvantages**                            |

| User-Friendly Interface                            | Some features only available in AndroVid Pro |
| All essential editing tools                        | Watermark                                    |
| Remove Watermark by watching ads (some cases only) | 7 Days free trial only                       |

## Part 1\. What is AndroVid App?

**Download:** You can download [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.androvid&hl=en&gl=US) from Google Play.

**Price:** As discussed before, you can use AndroVid for free. There aren’t many limitations in the features, almost all the components are available in the free version, but there are ads. When it comes to Watermark, there is one in the free version. You must purchase the AndroVid Pro monthly or yearly subscriptions to remove it. Some simple tools, such as merge, covert, compress, etc., do not have a watermark, though. AndroVid doesn't have any premium plugins either, but it does include an online asset shop for music, fonts, and other items that you can access more of by upgrading to Pro.
