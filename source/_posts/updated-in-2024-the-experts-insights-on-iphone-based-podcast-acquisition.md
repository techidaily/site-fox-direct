iOS devices, including iPhones, come with iOS's default podcast app, Apple Podcasts. The app is similar to Apple Music and allows discovering, subscribing, playing, and downloading the desired podcast episodes.

Step1 Find and open the Apple Podcasts app on your iPhone.

![download podcast iphone dedicated app 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-download-podcasts-on-iphone-3.jpg)

Step5 To download, tap on the small purple plus bottom at the right of the desired episode. Next, click on the small cloud button, and you will see a small status circle when an episode is successfully downloaded.

Download the Apple Podcast page for more details on the iPhone podcast. If you are still unsure how podcast downloading on your iPhone works with the dedicated app, the video [Podcast iPhone Download Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyMn3YNI0j8) will greatly help you check out the detailed process.

### This method is best for

The Apple Podcast app comes built-in with iOS devices, and no third-party tool or program is needed. Therefore, downloading podcasts using the default Apple Podcasts app is one of the most straightforward solutions.

However, when you do not have access to a computer or downloading additional software is not an option, like Google Podcasts, Apple's official Podcasts app can be your best option.

## Method 2\. Download podcasts on iPhone from a computer

Another method to have a collection of podcasts on your iPhone is first downloading them to your computer and then transferring them to your phone. Though third-party tools are available, the simplest method is to use iTunes.

**Steps to download podcasts on iPhone from a computer**

Step1 First, connect your iPhone to your computer using the USB cable.

Step2 Next, on your Windows system, run iTunes. Then, head to the “Podcasts” section. and download all the desired podcasts you wish to transfer to your phone.

![download podcasts from iTunes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-download-podcasts-on-iphone-7.jpg)

Step3 Next, tap on the iTunes menu and click "Add to Library," which will transfer the podcast to your connected iPhone.

For Mac users, you can try to find your podcast files in your User folder:

**\~/Library/Group Containers/243LU875E5.groups.com.apple.podcasts/Library/Cache**

In the Finder, go to the Go menu > Go to Folder, and paste in that link. That will take you some folders, and there should be a couple of Cache folders there. Open the Cache folder and look for files with an .mp3 extension. It can look like this (for a single downloaded podcast):

![download podcasts from a finder folder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-download-podcasts-on-iphone-8.jpg)

If you double click on that MP3, it plays a podcast. If this is something you may do often, copy that file path into a Notes document so you have it handy for next time. Or in the title bar of that window, click on the folder name and drag it to your sidebar so it creates a shortcut.

![copy that file path into a notes document](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-download-podcasts-on-iphone-9.jpg)

### This method is best for

If you do not have a Podcast app on your iPhone, using your computer will work as a great alternative. Moreover, for the users who have already downloaded their choice of podcasts on their system, this method works best as downloading the podcast is not needed, and you can transfer the ones present to your iPhone using iTunes.

## Bonus tip: How to download all episodes of a podcast on iPhone

If you need to download all the episodes of a podcast, downloading them one by one is not only tedious but also a time-consuming task. So, there is a fix for batch-downloading episodes on your iPhone.

You need to go to Settings > Podcasts and click on the Download Episodes option. Next, click on the All Unplayed button; with this, all podcast episodes will be downloaded to your iPhone.

![download all podcast episode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-download-podcasts-on-iphone-10.jpg)

## Why can't I download podcasts on my iPhone?

Having issues with podcast downloads is quite common. In such situations, the episodes might not be downloaded even after clicking on the download button or selecting the download preferences.

Those issues may happen for several reasons, like bugs, glitches, corrupt network settings, etc. Below are some of the most common reasons for the podcast download to fail and their solutions.

### Issue 1\. Temporary glitches

One of the most common reasons downloading episodes’ fail is temporary glitches that might result in the improper functioning of the podcast app.

**The best fix for the issue**

The simplest solution is to force quit and then re-open the podcast app. You can start by opening the iPhone App Switcher using Face ID or swiping up from the bottom of the screen. You can even double-press the Home button for this. Finally, you can even restart the phone to overcome the glitches.

![temporary glitches](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-download-podcasts-on-iphone-11.jpg)

### Issue 2\. Permission to use the cellular data

You don't have to be connected to Wi-Fi all the time, and in such situations, the

download will be done using cellular data. So, episodes will not be downloaded if the Podcasts app is not permitted to use cellular data.

**The best fix for the issue**

You need to grant permission to the app for this, go to Settings > Podcasts, and then make sure that the switch for Cellular Data is enabled. Also, check that the switch next to Block Downloads Over Cellular is disabled.

![cellular data permission](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-download-podcasts-on-iphone-12.jpg)

### Issue 3\. Server-side Issues

The downloading podcast issues may also arise when there are problems from the server side, not from the app or the device. These issues are represented through a status code, and thus, they can be interpreted using them.

**The best fix for the issue**

To fix this problem, you need to go to the Apple System page and check. Since there is no specific listing for the Podcast app, you would need to find out that there are no issues listed next to services like Apple Music, Apple ID, or App Store.

![server-side issues](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-download-podcasts-on-iphone-13.jpg)
