If you consider yourself to be a fan of the Boomerang app, then you are going to love using LoopVid, because it enables to capture goofy videos. The length of the video can vary from 1 to 9 seconds and the app creates an endless sequence that is perfect for capturing motion, falling objects or anything else that has a repetitive rhythm. LoopVid isn't really a GIF maker, so features, like adding text or importing footage from your camera roll, aren't available and the number of ads that pop up when the app is open might be frustrating.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-editor-gif-art-creator.jpg)

GIF X provides over 300 effects that can be applied to videos and photos and more than 200 masks that can be used to customize GIF effects. Adding music to GIFs is another remarkable feature offered by the GIF X app, but you must import the photos and videos from your camera roll or download them from GIPHY.

#### 9\. [GifLab](https://itunes.apple.com/app/giflab-gif-maker-editor-share-to-ig/id975415947)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/giflab-gif-maker.jpg)

Each GIF created with GifLab can be converted to video and shared on Instagram or easily shared anywhere else on the Internet.

### Frequently Asked Questions About GIF Apps for iPhone
