## What makes a good diving action camera

There are so many features that are considered to be essential for a diving camera unit. When you go to buy a new camera for your snorkelling needs, never forget to ask for following specifications:

1. **Ease of use:** All the controls must be easily accessible and one must have a clear idea about whether one control button is dedicated to specific function or its signals are shared. Ensure that you can operate its buttons even while wearing gloves and its layout must be well designed so that one can use it in every condition.
2. **Size and Weight:** Your camera must be available with protective under water housing so that it can be used without any damage. As most of the housings are close enough to the neutral point when it comes under water so you can pick any one with best protective shield.
3. **Budget:** One must know that underwater shooting is a costly affair so you must get ready to face the shocking price tags while buying a new camera unit. As you need to use it under water so it is necessary to buy all protective accessories too so plan your savings well to get an advanced camera unit to fulfil your dreams of underwater shooting.
