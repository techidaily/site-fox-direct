You will feel little annoying to know that its battery takes about 2 hours to get completely charged. So you have to wait so long to make it fly again.

#### 4\.  Flight Performance

 Typhoon offers 25 minutes flight time with the maximum speed of 45 meters per hour. This drone is designed with five unique modes for flight; one of these is the journey mode that helps to take of automatically and then starts taking selfie.

It works with sonar technology that means your device can easily detect all the undesired objects on the way even in low light conditions or in darkness.

But still, at least you have a new feature and it works amazingly.
