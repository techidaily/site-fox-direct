## Start Editing with Ease: Implementing Movie Maker in Windows 11

Microsoft's video editing tool, movie maker, which debuted 19 years ago, did not find the kind of success Microsoft had hoped for, and as a result, the firm was forced to stop supporting it.

However, the demise of the 19-year-old program opened the door for alternative **movie maker windows 11**, which is included with Windows 11.
