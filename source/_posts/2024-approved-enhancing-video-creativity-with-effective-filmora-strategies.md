## Question 2: Video editing skills

![questions from audience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/filmroa-questions-and-answers-7.png)

The best way to make a string disappear in your video is masking. Here is how you can use this feature to remove something from your clip. Follow the steps explained below.

##### Step1 Record the footage

First, record your shot from a slightly lower angle if the string is tied from above. Ensure the object to which the string is tied is not visible in the footage.

![record your clip from a slightly lower angle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/filmroa-questions-and-answers-8.gif)

Remove the object and string from the shot and record the background for about 10 seconds.

![record empty background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/filmroa-questions-and-answers-9.jpg)

##### Step2 Video editing

Now, launch the video editing software Wondershare Filmora. Drag and drop your empty background clip on the first video track.

![import clip with empty background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/filmroa-questions-and-answers-10.gif)

Now drag the other clip with the object and string on the second video track.

![import clip with the object](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/filmroa-questions-and-answers-11.gif)

Trim the clip to the duration of your choice. Double-click on your top clip, and then under the video tab, go into the mask and select or draw the mask shape you want.

![choose and select the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/filmroa-questions-and-answers-12.gif)

Move the mask around until the string is in the mask box.

## Question 4: About Filmora settings

![questions from audience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/filmroa-questions-and-answers-26.png)

It is a great question. You might have noticed a crown icon next to some features in Filmora. It is for specific editing features accessible to users only with a Filmora license.

These features include 4K video export, keyframing, speed ramping, and many more. Purchase a Filmora license from their official website and enjoy these beautiful features.

## Question 5: Filmora purchase

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
If you bought Filmora 9 lifetime license years ago, you can upgrade to Filmora X and use the same license. However, since Filmora X, there is no lifetime license anymore. Instead, a perpetual license is made for a specific version of Filmora. It includes minor updates continually with payment of a single fee, but for major upgrades, like Filmora 11 to Filmora 12, there will be an additional fee. Therefore, the answer is no.

If you bought Filmora 9 lifetime license years ago, you can upgrade to Filmora X and use the same license. However, since Filmora X, there is no lifetime license anymore. Instead, a perpetual license is made for a specific version of Filmora. It includes minor updates continually with payment of a single fee, but for major upgrades, like Filmora 11 to Filmora 12, there will be an additional fee. Therefore, the answer is no.
