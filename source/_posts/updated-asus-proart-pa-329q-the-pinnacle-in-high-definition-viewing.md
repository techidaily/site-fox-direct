 The Asus Pro Art PA 329Q is a professional LCD monitor that's capable of delivering 4K resolutions with a professional design that is built for image editors. This model is designed to be a high-caliber Pro selection and a regular use work monitor that has all of the specs necessary for a variety of digital work tasks. If you are looking for a top quality 32-inch monitor for the use of everyday working tasks the UHD 4k monitor is near the top of many pro designers lists.

**Pros and Cons**

 Overall this is a monitor that brings extensive value due to its LCD construction includes professional calibration software, and improved build quality, excellent styling for matching almost any office as well as an improved bright IPS panel, image quality, and Ultra HD resolutions.

 The biggest problems that face this monitor are definitely the OSD calibration which is extremely inflexible; what’s more, the software which does not support the use of high-end instruments or even PC sharing with one keyboard and mouse. Other top-quality professional monitors do include the use of these features but they are also considerably more expensive.

## Asus PA 329Q Design Quality

#### 1.Design Style

 The overall design of this device includes a 360° rotation for portrait mode, a sturdy and unique stand as well as a height adjustable operation. This is the type of monitor that you can use for ergonomic support day in and day out. The overall design style is made from modern office and it can be made to fit in almost any environment. Including eight ergonomic swivel, pivot, height adjustment and more is an ideal choice for many professionals who are looking for a monitor that they can use for preventing neck strain and improving long working hours each day.

 The look of this monitor also comes with a beautiful logo that improves the branding of the monitor as well as strong materials all finished in matte black. This matte black construction really helps to improve the look of the monitor overall and to make sure that it can fade into almost any office setting. The cabinet finish features a 10 mm bezel which is not too distracting and ensures that if multiple monitors needed to be used for one workstation this could be done quite easily. Overall the monitor size is great and with the design of the adjustments it's really easy to enjoy a functional design that goes far beyond the average 32 inch television or large display. The comfort adjustments on this make it perfect for professionals.

 The stand and base are manufactured and extremely minimalist design which is functional yet extremely strong and study. This ensures that the entire unit can stand up quite well in a large office or across many cubicles and hours of work. The PA329Q is known for being adjustable in every way that an ASUS is providing for all of its 4 k monitors. If you have used one of these monitors in the past they can be extremely comfortable over long uses making them ideal for a workplace setting.

#### 2. Ports and Connectivity

![asus-proart-pa329q-ports](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-proart-pa329q-ports.jpg)

 The PA 329Q has almost any type of port that you might require in a workplace including four HDMI version 2.0 ports, mini display port 1.2 a standard display port 1.2 as well as five USB 3.0 ports, a nine in one card reader as well as an earphone jack.

 Most of these ports are located directly underneath the monitor, and the only problem with this is that it can often lead to troubles with cord management. While most of the ports can be easily viewed by tilting the monitor, sometimes it can be difficult to plug items in for connectivity without first raising the monitor up or even tilting it all the way down. Once you have the monitor configured and everything plugged in, it's quite easy to use for day to day operations.

 The overall design of the ports and the location of these ports is for a minimalist design with the look of many items, such as cords and empty ports hidden away from view. Most of the settings and button features can be found along the side of the monitor where they can sometimes be hidden from view. When using the monitor in portrait mode these ports become much more accessible. For most high-end monitors, these types of ports are expected but it's tough to find too many monitors that have such a wealth of ports available for use at one time.

## Features and Performance

#### 1.OSD and Settings

 Overall this is a monitor designed for professional use and includes a wide color gamut of 100% REC .709, 99.5% Adobe RGB, wide color gamut for vibrant images and more. There are color spaces for video editing in 2020 as well as true to life color reproduction.

 What's really incredible with the color and image quality is the full customization that is available to professionals.

 This device can produce 1.0 7 billion colors with the chance to produce over 1024 shades of each primary color.

 Overall the image quality and color quality is perfect especially when the settings are dialed in the only aspect where this monitor falls short however is with brightness uniformity. Even many of the top Asus monitors find difficulty with uniformity compensation throughout the monitor face and this makes brightness at a fixed level of premium. The pure resolution and the size of the monitor ensures that pixels are close to invisible and the antiglare matte coating on the monitor makes it easy to read and easy to see colors in a variety of different lighting settings.

#### 3. Calibration

 Overall this monitor is extremely easy to work on right out-of-the-box. The calibration technology on ASUS however has always been a cut above. The PA329Q delivers DCI PIII color space support.

 As well as the features the color calibration tools that ASUS included just in the menu with the PA329Q make it extremely easy to calibrate in its multiple picture modes as well as through advanced settings that can all be found on the monitor.
