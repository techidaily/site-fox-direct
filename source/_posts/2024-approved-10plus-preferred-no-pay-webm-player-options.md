 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

The demand for online video has been increasing steadily over the course of the last ten years and this trend is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. The format in which a video file is saved often determines its quality and size, but as the file’s size decreases so does its quality.

That is the reason why Google developed the WebM file format that preserves a video’s quality while minimizing its size. Even though it has been nearly ten years since the WebM file format was first introduced it is still relatively difficult to find a media player that can play this type of video file. So, in this article, we are going to show you how to play WebM video files and introduce you to six free media players you can use to play WebM videos on Mac and PC computers.

## How to Play WebM Video Files on Windows and macOS without a Media Player?

WebM file format is commonly used for videos that are uploaded to the Internet, as they are relatively small in size and capable of delivering excellent image quality. For instance, YouTube videos in resolutions that vary from 360p to 4K are all saved in the WebM file format. In addition, web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge can all play WebM video files without the help of third-party media players.

In order to play a video saved in the WebM format from the Safari web browser, you must either install the [VLC web browser plugin for macOS X](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html). What’s more, you must make sure that the web browser you’re using to open a WebM video is updated, since older versions of Google Chrome, Opera or Mozilla Firefox cannot open the videos saved in this file format.

Note: If you want to edit the recorded WebM video files, you can check these [best free WebM video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## The Six Best Free WebM Media Players macOS and Windows 10

Besides viewing WebM videos through a web browser you can also use Mac and PC-based media players to watch WebM videos. However, finding a free media player that allows you to open a WebM video doesn’t have to be difficult, despite the fact that this video file format isn’t supported by all media players. So, let’s take a look at the six best WebM media player for macOS and Windows 10.

### 1\. VLC

**Compatibility:** Mac, Windows, Linux

This open-source media player supports nearly all video file formats, including the WebM format, which makes it a perfect option for both Mac and PC users. The process of opening and playing a video in VLC is the same regardless of the format in which they are saved. After you launch VLC, you just have to select the Open File option from the Media menu and then navigate to the location on your hard drive at which the WebM video you want to play is saved. Click on the file to select it and proceed to click on the Open button. Optionally you can just drag the WebM video from the folder, drop it in VLC and it will start playing automatically.

### 2\. Windows Media Player

**Compatibility:** Windows

PC owners can play WebM videos without having to install a media player because Windows Media Player can open and play video files saved in WebM format. However, you cannot do so without the necessary audio and video codecs. If you have Windows Media Player 12 you will have to install WebM Media Foundation Components, while for the earlier versions of the software you must install WebM DirectShow filters. All you need to do in order to open a WebM video with Windows Media Player is double-click on it in the Media Library and it will start playing immediately.

### 3\. MPlayerX

**Compatibility:** macOS

This is a simple media player that supports nearly all existing video file formats. Opening a WebM video in MPlayerX doesn’t take much more than a few moments of your time since you just have to drop a file into this media player and it will start playing automatically. MPlayerX is equipped with FFmpeg, so you don’t have to install any additional codecs. This media player for the macOS is a perfect option for home theater systems or watching online videos because you don’t have to adjust any settings. Moreover, you can use the Apple Remote Controls to play or pause all videos you watch in MPlayerX.

### 4\. KM Player

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Playing WebM or any other type of video file with KM Player is easy since it supports a broad range of file formats and it even allows you to watch videos in 8K resolution. You should keep in mind that KM Player isn’t designed for use on low-end computers and you cannot install it unless you have a 64-bit version of Windows 10 or OS X 10.6 or later. You can use this cross-platform media player to watch UHD, 4K and 8K videos at 60fps. Watching YouTube videos from KM Player is also an option you will have at your disposal if you decide to install this media player on your computer.

### 5\. Miro

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS, Linux

Miro enables you to do much more than just play a wide spectrum of audio and video files, as it makes it easy to organize your video or music libraries or purchase apps from Amazon or Google Play stores. In addition, you can subscribe to podcasts, sync your files to Android and Kindle fire devices or share media between devices on the same network. Miro player can also be used to download and watch YouTube videos and it allows you to convert video files in almost any format you want. However, playing videos in 4K or higher resolutions is not possible with this media player.

### 6\. 5K Player

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS

This is a powerful media player that can play virtually any type of video file. 5K Player supports the playback of 5K, 4K, 360-degree or Full HD videos and it supports nearly all commonly used audio file formats. That’s why it is hardly surprising that playing a WebM video in 5K Player is a straightforward process that won’t take much more than a few moments of your time. Downloading videos from Vimeo, Facebook YouTube or Dailymotion is yet another option you’ll have if you choose 5K Player as your primary media player.

## How to Play WebM files on iOS and Android Operating Systems

WebM videos can be played on all Android devices that have Android 2.3 Gingerbread or later version of the OS, without installing a third-party media player. This means that you can watch the WebM videos that are stored locally or on the Internet directly from your phone. However, iPhone owners cannot watch WebM videos before they install an app that allows them to open a video saved in the WebM format.

Installing the [PlayerXtreme Media Player](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/playerxtreme-media-player/id456584471) will solve this issue, as the app that supports file formats like 3gp, MKV, ISO, or WebM among numerous others. The app supports playback of audio and video files in HD resolution and allows you to download subtitles for free in just a few easy taps.

Saving videos from devices that are connected to the same network, accessing WebM and all other types of video files via a web browser or casting videos on large screens with Google Cast or AirPlay are also among the options you will have at your disposal if you install PlayerXtreme Media Player on your iPhone. Even though this app can be downloaded for free, opting for a monthly subscription or upgrading to the pro version of the app may be a good idea if you want to use it on a daily basis.

**Conclusion**

WebM video file format is still widely regarded as the file format for Internet videos. Even so finding a media player that will enable you to watch WebM videos from a Smartphone, Mac or PC computer shouldn’t be too hard since VLC player is already one of the most commonly used media players in the world.
