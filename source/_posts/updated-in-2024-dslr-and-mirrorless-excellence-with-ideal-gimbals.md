A Gimbal is usually designed with 3 brushless motors and they help operators to move their camera easily on all axis.

### Section 2: 2 Axis or 3 Axis Gimbal?

 You will generally find two types of gimbals in market: 2-axis and 3-axis. Selection for anyone of these totally depends upon your application.

 Generally, the 3 axis gimbals are preferred for aerial applications in drones and RC helicopters. They also find applications in applications where camera is to be attached on a car suction mount, camera jib or any remote controlled vehicle. 3 axis gimbals have higher control on camera stabilization.
