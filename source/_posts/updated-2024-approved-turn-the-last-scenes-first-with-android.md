## Part 4: How to Reverse video with VN on Android?

VN Video Editor, also known as VN Video Editor Maker VlogNow, is a multimedia tool for editing video material on your Android smartphone or tablet. The version is free for use, with no watermarks or other restrictions, and is said to be highly effective in a variety of editing tasks for several of today's streaming video demands.

The editing functions themselves are essential enough but not very sturdy. The transitioning is also nicer than what you'll get on many free applications, but certainly a step less than you'll get on more significant NLE sites. VN Video Editor is best suited for editing footage shot straight from your phone (but not in-app). The textual and subtitle options are ideal for creating material for TikTok or YouTube.

To play a reverse video with VN Video Editor on Android, follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Download and install VN and launch it on your Android phone.

**Step 2:** Click on the **+** icon from the bottom and tap **New Project.**

**Step 3:** Navigate the video you wish to reverse and select it by tapping it and upload it by pressing the **blue ->** button in the right corner.

**Step 4:** Now slide towards the right and click on **Reverse** from the bottom menu.

**Step 5:** After the reverse procedure is complete, click **Export** to save the reversed video.

## Part 5: How to reverse a video on Android with PowerDirector Video Editor App

PowerDirector is intelligent reverse video software that also has a slew of other valuable functions. This reverse video app enables reverse playback as well as customizable speed. Its features are also available for free exploration and use.

Aside from the video editing capabilities, there are several excellent features that you may add to your video. You may use the Efectum app just to invert your video, but if you want to perform more editing, such as adding numerous clips, music in the background, script, and special effects, we suggest the PowerDirector software.

To play a reverse video with PowerDirector Video Editor on Android, follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Launch the PowerDirector Video Editor app on your phone after downloading and installing it.

**Step 2:** Create a new project by clicking on **New Project** and upload the video you wish to reverse,

**Step 3:** Now, click on the video from the timeline, and then press the **Pencil** option from the popup.

**Step 4:** Click on the **Reverse** option to reverse the video. The reversing procedure will take some moments.

**Step 5:** After the reversing is complete, the video will automatically be saved in your gallery.

**Note:** You can keep on editing the video even after reversing it.

**Conclusion**

Playing a video backward can make even the most boring events comedic. Even though these video reverse applications are unique in their use of the reverse feature, Filmora remains the finest intuitive software to **reverse video Android.**

You may also experiment with Filmora's sophisticated tools such as filters, effects, animation stickers, and much more. These sophisticated capabilities will undoubtedly give your film a stunning effect and set it apart from the crowd.
