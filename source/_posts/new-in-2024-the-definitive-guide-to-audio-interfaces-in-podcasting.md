### What does “better audio quality” mean?

“A better audio quality” means you can understand people’s voices more clearly. A sound recorded or reproduced in such a way as to have improved clarity or intelligibility over existing recordings, or to provide greater depth of perception.” In other words, it describes an improvement.

Listening to someone speaking over the phone while trying to talk to them in person, their voice may sound garbled. Because noise surrounds the person’s mouth, creating a distortion in their voice that makes it impossible to decipher who is saying what.

### Which parameters determine “better audio quality”?

A microphone records sound waves, and digitization processes the sound waves and converts them into digital data called parameters. The main parameters include

**Sample Rate**

This is how many audio samples are being recorded per second. Frequency response is the response of a signal to the input. The higher the sample rate, the more information, and detail in the sound.

For example, 44100 (44.1kHz) samples per second are considered good quality.

![sample rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/what-is-audio-interface-for-podcasting-2.jpg)

**Bit Depth**

Bit depth controls the dynamic range of the recording and measures how many bits of information can be recorded for each sample.

The lowest bit depth you should use for professional recordings is 16-bit, but many digital audio recorders offer up to 32-bit floating settings with a higher dynamic range.

### What does “better audio quality” mean?

“A better audio quality” means you can understand people’s voices more clearly. A sound recorded or reproduced in such a way as to have improved clarity or intelligibility over existing recordings, or to provide greater depth of perception.” In other words, it describes an improvement.

Listening to someone speaking over the phone while trying to talk to them in person, their voice may sound garbled. Because noise surrounds the person’s mouth, creating a distortion in their voice that makes it impossible to decipher who is saying what.

### Which parameters determine “better audio quality”?

A microphone records sound waves, and digitization processes the sound waves and converts them into digital data called parameters. The main parameters include

**Sample Rate**

This is how many audio samples are being recorded per second. Frequency response is the response of a signal to the input. The higher the sample rate, the more information, and detail in the sound.

For example, 44100 (44.1kHz) samples per second are considered good quality.

![sample rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/what-is-audio-interface-for-podcasting-2.jpg)

**Bit Depth**

Bit depth controls the dynamic range of the recording and measures how many bits of information can be recorded for each sample.

The lowest bit depth you should use for professional recordings is 16-bit, but many digital audio recorders offer up to 32-bit floating settings with a higher dynamic range.

## Part 6\. Additional essential podcasting equipment for a podcast show

Most people aren’t aware that so much more equipment is required to put on a podcast than simply a microphone. Whether audio-recording software or a mixing board, many pieces of equipment are necessary to produce quality audio and video content. Here are the most important equipment needed to create a good podcast.

### Microphone and Stand

![microphone and stand](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/what-is-audio-interface-for-podcasting-7.jpg)
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

One of the first things you need to get started podcasting is a good microphone, and a quality tripod stands for it. When you’re recording podcasts, you want to ensure you’re getting the best sound. To do so, you need a high-quality microphone that should be durable yet comfortable.

The microphone stand is also one of the essential pieces of audio equipment, as it is used to hold the mic in an optimal position to ensure that the sound quality is at its best.

### Mixer

![mixer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/what-is-audio-interface-for-podcasting-8.jpg)

The mixer is the most important piece of equipment for a podcast because it is used for recording and mixing audio. It allows you to adjust the volume of individual mics, which makes it possible to add multiple mics to your podcast. It also allows you to adjust the volume of the overall podcast.

### Headphones

![headphones](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/what-is-audio-interface-for-podcasting-9.jpg)

Headphones are required if you want to listen to podcasts during your commute. And the best ones for you depend on what kind of audio quality you prefer. A good pair of headphones will last you a long time. They are either wired or wireless; we recommend choosing wired over wireless because they offer low latency and are cheaper than wireless.
