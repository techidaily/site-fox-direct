## Formulating Flashy Podcast Moments

Podcasts are a rising trend nowadays for streamers.

A fantastic podcast trailer can surely help you in boosting your audience range. It also helps to publish your podcast on any big platform like Apple.

## Part 2\. How to make a good podcast trailer? 5 Tips for it
