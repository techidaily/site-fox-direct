In some cases, you may find an existing audio or music track in the video. This particular track may spoil the complete video and create multiple problems. Here, it will be a nice decision to separate the video from the existing audio. It can be possible by using the DETACH AUDIO TRACK features. After detaching the audio, you can also edit that particular one, such as – modifying, altering, or removing. For saving time and avoid multiple menu interactions, you can proceed by using the shortcut command. It is – Ctrl+Alt+D.
