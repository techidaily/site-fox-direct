According to the interval and number of shots, your Canon 80d time-lapse will tell you the number of footage you have to take to end the video.

**Use manual mode:-** It's recommended to shoot in manual mode, and you must shoot with the manual white balance, exposure, aperture, and shutter speed. Moreover, it will help you to avoid auto-adjusting your camera.
