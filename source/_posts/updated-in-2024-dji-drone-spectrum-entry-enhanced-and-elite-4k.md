 Phantom 3 comes in four different models: [Standard](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), 4K, Professional and Advanced. When we talk about standard unit then it is rated as an affordable product for beginners whereas remaining three models are feature rich and have unique specifications that suits to professional needs.

 As all these models use to have competing features so it is really difficult for a buyer to make decision about which product is best for particular needs. The article below provides detailed comparison between all four Phantom models so that buyers can make an easy and efficient decision about their investment.

## Conclusion

 All Phantom models are well designed and offer great features as per their price point. They focus on needs of regular users as well as on professional requirements. So we can say that none of these is a bad choice. If you are ready to buy a drone for your flight experience then it is important to make a list of all features and specifications first that you want to enjoy during your flights. Also have a look on your budget or savings. Then go for detailed comparison between these available phantom products and soon you will be able to choose the best drone unit for yourself.

 Let me remind you that, all these four models are equipped with GPS position hold feature, point of interest ability, follow me mode, waypoints, home lock, course lock, real time battery monitoring facility and the return to home feature. Further all of them offer flight time estimation feature, stabilized videos and photos along with manual camera exposure control. The only unique thing is the video resolution level and price that you need to focus upon; however these drones can ensure great details even at 720p resolution level due to gimbal support.
