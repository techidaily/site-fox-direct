## Part 1\. Top 10 Meme Template Ideas

Social media doesn't have to be just serious and instructive. You may also enjoy it a little bit! Adding comedy or relevant material is really a terrific strategy to engage your readers. The decade's biggest cultural phenomena are memes. Every human phenomenon has a meme equivalent, but certain forms have shown to be more effective and durable over time than others, both in terms of narrative flexibility and the opportunity for innovative remixes. We've picked the top 10 meme templates below.

### 1\. Burning Paper

A year without a new SpongeBob meme is nothing. In this meme, SpongeBob may be seen reading a document with some mockery before burning it without looking back. This sample only demonstrates the lack of interest some individuals have in anything.

### 2\. They Can’t Read

What more effective approach to convey a point than via a meme? Using this template, you may express a strong or unpopular stance while simultaneously making snide remarks about others who disagree with you.

### 3\. I Am Once Again Asking

This priceless meme was lifted from one of Bernie Sanders' campaign materials. This example just demonstrates how desperate people would do anything, no matter how humiliating. And we apologize to Bernie personally for our shortcomings.
