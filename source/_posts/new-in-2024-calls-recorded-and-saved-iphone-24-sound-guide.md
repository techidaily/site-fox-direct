## Calls Recorded & Saved: IPhone '24 Sound Guide

As all of us know, voicemails are one of the most advanced ways of communication over internet, so there are also trends nowadays. Many big messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, Viber, etc., have successfully added this feature to their software. You can mail or send your voice message to another user over a network and may get a reply in the same voicemail form. So, let's start discussing the **voicemail recorder on iPhone** briefly in the following to help you understand more!

## Part 1\. What is voicemail?

A voicemail is usually an audio form of a message sent by a user digitally over a network to another user on the same network. It is one of the most used types of messaging nowadays. Many people on the internet prefer to send a voicemail instead of a text mail because it seems to be more personal than it. In simple words, a voicemail is a digital audio message sent by or recorded by a user for another user. Also, another definition of it is that voicemail is a computerized system that allows users to easily exchange audio messages among themselves.

## Part 2\. Why should people use it?

Voicemail is a more convenient way to communicate with someone than text messaging. Moreover, the others can leave a voice message for you when you are offline. Once messages have been placed in the voice mailbox, the owner can be informed through phone or pager. They can also call their own voice mailbox, extract the message, and re-listen before saving, deleting, or other operations at any time. Additionally, voicemail offers the advantages of strong anonymity and is not location- or time-based, so an increasing number of people are using it.
