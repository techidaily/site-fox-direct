## Part I. How to Speed Up Songs on Spotify?

Firstly, consider if the process of **changing a song's speed on Spotify** is directly applicable to the platform. The answer to that is no. As of the time of this writing, Spotify or any of the well-known online audio streaming sites still need to offer the music playback speed adjustment feature. This applies to both web and mobile versions while streaming songs.

While there is no direct function for adjusting Spotify songs or even podcasts' playback speed, you can use the [Spotify Playback Speed Access](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spotify-playback-speed-ac/cgbihpjbhpdfbdckcabcniojdhcgblhd) of Spotify Web Player. This is a Google Chrome extension that allows users the ability to **speed up Spotify songs**, mainly on the web app version.
