Suppose, you wish to shoot a blooming bud or the even smaller pollens, the bugs or the worms, capturing the macro elements of nature needs a certain skill.</p><p>Shooting macro video is an art form because it requires balancing the technicalities of the camera along with the aesthetic and creative beauty of nature.</p><p>Any person having a photography background can learn the nuances of the macro video quickly as macro photohgraphy is usually a part of their subject and macro video is an extension of the same.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="6-Tips-For-Making-Macro-Video"><a href="#6-Tips-For-Making-Macro-Video" class="headerlink" title="6 Tips For Making Macro Video"></a>6 Tips For Making Macro Video</h2><p>The difference between the macro video and the macro photo mainly depends on the light acquisition.</p><p>You need a good amount of light in the macro photography whereas, in <a class="link"   href="http://www.uwphotographyguide.com/3-tips-underwater-macro-video" >macro video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it is not possible to have a continuous light focus on the small subject.</p><p>You may hand-hold the camera to click a macro photograph but, it is not possible in case of macro video. The 6 tips below could give you some thoughts.</p><h4 id="1-The-Importance-Of-Lighting"><a href="#1-The-Importance-Of-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="1. The Importance Of Lighting"></a>1. The Importance Of Lighting</h4><p>While shooting the depth of a subject in the macro video, proper lighting is highly essential. The object you are capturing must have a good amount of light focus on it.</p><p>But, you must be prepared to use your intelligence as well as creativity with the shooting.</p><p>For example, while shooting rare species snails that cannot be exposed to halogen light due to the heat produced by it, you can creatively use the LED lights which are cooler.</p><p>You must be careful to use the right kind of light according to your shooting subject.</p><p>Like while shooting a shiny object that can reflect the light, you may use diffusing lights by making a paper cone, focussing on the subject, and evenly directing the lights through the paper to lessen the glare while macro video shooting.</p><p>Around the lens, you may use a ring of LED lights in order to avert the incoming light while shooting a subject very closely.</p><h4 id="2-Tripod"><a href="#2-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="2. Tripod"></a>2. Tripod</h4><p>How can a tripod be helpful in capturing a macro video?</p><p>A macro video is shot from a close distance. If your camera is in motion, it can spoil your video. A tripod helps in a stable and steady macro video shoot, although being completely dependent on the tripod is not a great idea.</p><p>Try to get great visual perspectives or angles by bracing the camera on the tree or ground on any other stable object.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/oconnor-ultimate-1030d-fluid-head-30l-cf-tripod.jpg"                      alt="Tripod"                ></p><h4 id="3-Background"><a href="#3-Background" class="headerlink" title="3. Background"></a>3. Background</h4><p>The background of your macro video always remains blurred as you shoot it closely. But, the background color is visible so, choosing it correctly is vital. The color of the background must compliment your composition’s color and must be chosen creatively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/separate-the-foreground-from-background.jpg"                      alt="background"                ></p><h4 id="4-DSLR-Cameras"><a href="#4-DSLR-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="4. DSLR Cameras"></a>4. DSLR Cameras</h4><p>For capturing the macro video, you can consider digital SLR camera. The macro lens of the digital SLR camera is a great option for capturing.</p><p>If you are a Canon user, you may opt for the 180 mm macro, 100 mm macro or the 65 mm MP-E lens to shoot the macro video.</p><p>You may also add an extension tube which basically splits the focal distance in two equal halves and make the image size bigger but it decreases the depth of the field.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dslr-camera-full-rig.jpg"                      alt="dslr camera"                ></p><h4 id="5-Depth-of-Field"><a href="#5-Depth-of-Field" class="headerlink" title="5. Depth of Field"></a>5. Depth of Field</h4><p>The lens has certain limitation to capture and focus the subject closely. The camera’s aperture can be adjusted to control the depth of your field.</p><p>What is an aperture? It is the opening of the lens. The smaller the opening of the lens is, the better is the depth of field for your macro video.</p><p>But, you must remember that when the opening of the lens is small, the light required is more. There must be an equal balance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/depth-of-field.JPG"                      alt="depth of field"                ></p><h4 id="6-Composition"><a href="#6-Composition" class="headerlink" title="6. Composition"></a>6. Composition</h4><p>When you have low lights, ensuring a correct perspective on the subject with maximum focus area is quite difficult. You must have the right composition for your macro video.</p><p>For instance, in order to keep a snail always in focus, you may choose to shoot it while it crawls perpendicular to the camera. If you shoot while it crawls towards you, only a part of the snail remains in focus at a certain point of time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/composition.JPG"                      alt="composition"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1001453/11832" target="_top" id="1001453">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1001453" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1001453/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Once you can master the above tips for making the macro video, you can easily shoot small objects like a pro. A videographer’s experience and creativity can be matched even by you if you can easily grasp the techniques, practice it, and implement creatively while making your macro videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1557747/17382" target="_top" id="1557747">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1557747" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1557747/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-ps-gaming-audio-masterclass-vocal-tweaks-for-2024/"><u>[New] PS Gaming Audio Masterclass - Vocal Tweaks for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-best-6-modern-homes-for-minecraft-enthusiasts/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Best 6 Modern Homes for Minecraft Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-brand-storytelling-through-imagery-a-podcast-designers-guide/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Brand Storytelling Through Imagery A Podcast Designer's Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-lg-monitor-in-depth-analysis-and-user-feedback/"><u>[Updated] LG Monitor In-Depth Analysis and User Feedback</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-unveiling-the-mystery-scriptwriting-for-documentaries-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unveiling the Mystery Scriptwriting for Documentaries for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/iphone-ipad-ipodmac/"><u>完全ガイド：iPhone, iPad, iPodを使ってMacにファイルを転送し、バックアップする方法</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/articulating-imagination-chatgpts-creative-edge/"><u>Articulating Imagination: ChatGPT's Creative Edge</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/comprehensive-review-of-vivavideo-app/"><u>Comprehensive Review of VivaVideo App</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/in-2024-audience-advocacy-nurturing-connections-in-the-digital-age/"><u>In 2024, Audience Advocacy Nurturing Connections in the Digital Age</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/in-2024-no-more-quick-yt-thumbnails-full-length-viewing/"><u>In 2024, No More Quick YT Thumbnails Full-Length Viewing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-remove-the-lock-screen-fingerprint-of-your-samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Remove the Lock Screen Fingerprint Of Your Samsung Galaxy A15 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-impact-of-music-on-a-trailers-emotional-pull/"><u>In 2024, The Impact of Music on a Trailer's Emotional Pull</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/lensblend-elite-cohesive-image-composer-for-2024/"><u>LensBlend Elite Cohesive Image Composer for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/perfecting-presentation-adding-textures-to-your-project/"><u>Perfecting Presentation Adding Textures to Your Project</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/startech-hardware-and-software-troubleshooting-windows-1ndriver-issues-on-various-os-versions/"><u>StarTech Hardware & Software: Troubleshooting Windows 1nDriver Issues on Various OS Versions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/taking-comedy-to-the-digital-frontier-your-gif-creation-roadmap-for-2024/"><u>Taking Comedy to the Digital Frontier Your GIF Creation Roadmap for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-tips-resolving-netflix-issues-on-your-roku-device/"><u>Troubleshooting Tips: Resolving Netflix Issues on Your Roku Device</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Getting-Ahead-with-Snapchat’s-Latest-Features"><a href="#Getting-Ahead-with-Snapchat’s-Latest-Features" class="headerlink" title="Getting Ahead with Snapchat’s Latest Features"></a>Getting Ahead with Snapchat’s Latest Features</h2><p>Snapchat is one of the most popular instant messaging apps. The key feature that makes it different from other messaging apps is that users can send text messages, pictures, and short videos that disappear after they are viewed.</p><p>Over the years, Snapchat has introduced various features that elevated its status from being an instant messaging app to a social media platform. In November 2020, Snapchat rolled out a new feature called Spotlight that has become a massive hit among users.</p><p>The Spotlight feature aims to make Snapchat compete with TikTok and Instagram Reels. As you may have guessed now, Spotlight is a collection of the most entertaining videos posted by app users.</p><p>Whether you want to post your videos on Snapchat Spotlight or want to know more about them, you just need to go through this article.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-Exactly-is-Snapchat-Spotlight"><a href="#What-Exactly-is-Snapchat-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="What Exactly is Snapchat Spotlight?"></a>What Exactly is Snapchat Spotlight?</h2><p>Snapchat introduced Spotlight as a whole new section in its app that features several engaging short videos, also known as Snaps. The maximum duration of a video can be up to 1 minute or 60 seconds. Content creators must submit their videos to Spotlight so that moderators can review them and decide if they are worthy of featuring in the Spotlight section.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the intention of adding the Spotlight feature in Snapchat is to engage users through short-form user videos, just like TikTok. After the massive popularity gained by TikTok in 2020, many platforms tried following the same path to glory, including Snapchat and Instagram.</p><h3 id="Snapchat-Spotlight-vs-TikTok-Main-Differences"><a href="#Snapchat-Spotlight-vs-TikTok-Main-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Snapchat Spotlight vs TikTok: Main Differences"></a>Snapchat Spotlight vs TikTok: Main Differences</h3><p>When comparing Snapchat and TikTok, there are specific differences that you can quickly notice. Let’s discuss those differences below:</p><p><strong>● Comments Sections</strong></p><p>While watching short-form videos on TikTok, you can leave your thoughts in the comments. However, you get no such comments section in the Snapchat Spotlight.</p><p><strong>● Privacy Protection</strong></p><p>If we talk about TikTok, you can view the display name of the content creator for each video. On the other hand, Snapchat enforces a strict privacy protection mechanism that hides the display name of creators if they are under 18. However, there’s an option to use a public profile if users below 18 wish to make their display name available to viewers.</p><h3 id="Guidelines-for-Submitting-Snapchat-Spotlight"><a href="#Guidelines-for-Submitting-Snapchat-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="Guidelines for Submitting Snapchat Spotlight"></a>Guidelines for Submitting Snapchat Spotlight</h3><p>It’s easy to submit snaps (short-form videos) on Snapchat Spotlight. However, it is essential to ensure that your videos adhere to specific guidelines set by Snapchat. This section aims to make you familiar with them.</p><p><strong>Video Requirements</strong></p><p>The snaps that you want to submit to Spotlight should meet the following technical requirements:</p><ul><li>The minimum duration of a snap is 5 seconds, while the maximum is 60 seconds.</li><li>The video should be in portrait orientation.</li><li>The minimum aspect ratio of a snap is 3:4.</li><li>The horizontal resolution of a snap must be at least 640 px.</li><li>There shouldn’t be any logo in the snap.</li><li>The content of the snap should cover the complete frame.</li></ul><p>If your snap doesn’t meet the above-mentioned requirements, it will become ineligible for getting featured on Spotlight.</p><p><strong>Submission Terms</strong></p><p>There are certain community guidelines that apply to all Spotlight snaps. These guidelines ensure that the snaps within Spotlight entertain people without hurting their sentiments in any way.</p><p>While posting a snap on Spotlight, you need to avoid content that contains the following:</p><ul><li>Sexual acts</li><li>Harassment and bullying</li><li>Threats, violence, or harm</li><li>Illegal activities</li><li>Terrorism and hate speech</li></ul><p>You can go through the official <a class="link"   href="https://snap.com/en-US/community-guidelines" >Snapchat community guidelines <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to learn more.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-Snapchat-Spotlight"><a href="#How-to-Use-Snapchat-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Snapchat Spotlight?"></a>How to Use Snapchat Spotlight?</h2><p>Snapchat Spotlight is relatively easy to use, especially if you are familiar with YouTube Shorts and TikTok. If you want to submit snaps to Spotlight, you will be happy to know that the whole process is quick and straightforward. The only thing that will consume a significant time is the snap creation itself.</p><p>If you already have a video or a snap idea that can make it to Spotlight, you need to know the steps for submitting a snap to Spotlight.

Then, here comes another important question: How to become a successful Snapchat creator?</p><p>Similar to TikTok and YouTube Shorts, there’s massive competition among creators on Snapchat. Both existing and new creators submit numerous snaps daily to get featured on Spotlight. So, how come you improve your chances of making it to Spotlight?</p><p>Well, the first thing you need to know is the algorithm that Snapchat Spotlight utilizes to show snaps to users. Secondly, there are some tips to help you build your Snapchat community. We’ll discuss both of them in the following sections.</p><h3 id="Snapchat-Spotlight-Algorithm-A-Brief-Overview"><a href="#Snapchat-Spotlight-Algorithm-A-Brief-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Snapchat Spotlight Algorithm: A Brief Overview"></a>Snapchat Spotlight Algorithm: A Brief Overview</h3><p>Snapchat makes use of a specialized algorithm for Spotlight. The algorithm decides what snaps to show to a particular user based on their interests and other factors.</p><p>The following are the key factors that the Spotlight algorithm considers for showing users the most relevant and exciting snaps.</p><p><strong>Unique Views</strong></p><p>A unique view means a user viewed a snap at least once in a single session. If a user views a snap multiple times in a single session, it will still be considered a unique view.</p><p><strong>Total View Time</strong></p><p>It represents the total time that users have spent watching a snap. If a user watches a single snap multiple times, the duration of each individual view will be added to the total view time.</p><p><strong>Number of Times the Video was Shared</strong></p><p>It represents the total number of times Snapchat users shared a particular snap with others.</p><p><strong>Number of Screenshots</strong></p><p>This factor considers the total number of times a screenshot was taken of a snap by a user.</p><h3 id="Quick-Tips-to-Build-Your-Snapchat-Community"><a href="#Quick-Tips-to-Build-Your-Snapchat-Community" class="headerlink" title="Quick Tips to Build Your Snapchat Community"></a>Quick Tips to Build Your Snapchat Community</h3><p>Your Snapchat community is your audience who loves to watch and interact with your snaps. Building a Snapchat community means growing your audience by delivering genuine, entertaining, and engaging content.</p><p>Here are some tips that can help you build a Snapchat community.</p><p><strong>Choose a Niche</strong></p><p>Uploading random snaps will not earn you a loyal audience on Spotlight. So, you need to pick a specific niche, such as gaming, pranks, and comedy, to target a particular audience with your snaps.</p><p><strong>Use Snapchat’s Built-in Creative Tools</strong></p><p>Snapchat provides several tools to help you become more creative with your snaps. Using those creative tools is good as the Spotlight algorithm pretends to prioritize videos edited with Snapchat’s native tools.</p><p><strong>Stay Consistent</strong></p><p>It is challenging to post snaps consistently, especially if you are just starting. However, maintaining consistency with your Snaps will help you earn more audience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896541/19272" target="_top" id="1896541">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896541" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896541/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="A-Bonus-Tip-A-Great-Video-Editor-Facilitates-Your-Snapchat-Creating-Journey"><a href="#A-Bonus-Tip-A-Great-Video-Editor-Facilitates-Your-Snapchat-Creating-Journey" class="headerlink" title="A Bonus Tip: A Great Video Editor Facilitates Your Snapchat Creating Journey"></a>A Bonus Tip: A Great Video Editor Facilitates Your Snapchat Creating Journey</h2><p>Hopefully, you have known how to use Snapchat Spotlight and been ready to plan your creator life.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Mastering-Shadows-Highlights-Through-Photoshop-Curves"><a href="#Mastering-Shadows-Highlights-Through-Photoshop-Curves" class="headerlink" title="Mastering Shadows &amp; Highlights Through Photoshop Curves"></a>Mastering Shadows &amp; Highlights Through Photoshop Curves</h2><p>In this Photoshop tutorial, we’re going to carve an image using four simple steps. Curving an image can be a great way to add some extra visual interest and dimension, and it’s a technique that can be used with a wide range of images. So, let’s get started!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/curve-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="curve image photoshop"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Simple-Steps-to-Curve-an-Image-in-Photoshop"><a href="#Simple-Steps-to-Curve-an-Image-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Simple Steps to Curve an Image in Photoshop"></a>Simple Steps to Curve an Image in Photoshop</h2><h5 id="Step1Create-a-New-Document"><a href="#Step1Create-a-New-Document" class="headerlink" title="Step1Create a New Document"></a>Step1Create a New Document</h5><p>To keep things simple, let’s start with a white canvas. Let’s open a new document now by going to File in the menu bar and tapping New. Alternatively, you may press Ctrl+N or Command+N on your keyboard to generate a new document. Choose a size and orientation that is appropriate for your image.</p><h5 id="Step2Place-the-Image"><a href="#Step2Place-the-Image" class="headerlink" title="Step2Place the Image"></a>Step2Place the Image</h5><p>After creating the new document, open the image that you want to curve. You may do so by going to File &gt; Open in the menu bar or pressing Ctrl+O or Command+O on your keyboard. Once the image is open, go to Edit in the menu bar and select Place Embedded from the drop-down menu that appears. Select your image and click Place. The image will be placed on the canvas. If the document’s size does not match that of the image, you will see a transformation box surrounding the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/place-image-in-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="place image in photoshop"                ></p><h5 id="Step3Warp-the-Image"><a href="#Step3Warp-the-Image" class="headerlink" title="Step3Warp the Image"></a>Step3Warp the Image</h5><p>Now we’ll curve the image using the Warp Tool. Select the Warp Tool by clicking and holding on the Transform Tool in the toolbar. The Warp Tool is located at the bottom of the Transform Tool’s fly-out menu. Alternatively, you may press Ctrl+T or Command+T on your keyboard to open the Transform Tool’s fly-out menu and then select the Warp Tool from there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/wrap-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="wrap image photoshop"                ></p><p>With the Warp Tool selected, hover your cursor over the image. You’ll see a grid appear over the image. Click and drag one of the middle nodes in the horizontal direction to begin curving the image. As you drag, you’ll see the image curve along with your cursor. If you want to increase or decrease the amount of curvature, simply press and hold the Shift key while dragging the node.</p><p>Play around with the settings in the options bar. There are quite a few different looks you can achieve just by adjusting these.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/change-image-height-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="change image height photoshop"                ></p><p>20% <strong>Horizontal Distortion</strong> makes one side of the image appear larger than the other. This is what my photo looks like at 20%.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/change-horizontal-distortion-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="change horizontal distortion photoshop"                ></p><p><strong>Vertical Distortion</strong> makes the image look as if it’s leaning backward.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/verticle-distortion-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="verticle distortion image photoshop"                ></p><p>The <strong>Bend Direction</strong> option rotates the angle of the bend.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/bend-direction-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="bend direction image photoshop"                ></p><p>Flip any of these effects in the opposite direction by placing a negative sign in front of the percentage. Here’s -20% in the <strong>Bend</strong> box with a vertical bend.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/flip-effect-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="flip effect image photoshop"                ></p><h5 id="Step4Save-the-Image"><a href="#Step4Save-the-Image" class="headerlink" title="Step4Save the Image"></a>Step4Save the Image</h5><p>Once you’re happy with the way your image looks, go to File &gt; Save As in the menu bar or press Ctrl+Shift+S or Command+Shift+S on your keyboard. Choose a file format and location to save your image and click Save. And that’s it! You’ve successfully curved</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/save-curve-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="save curve image photoshop"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094480/7443" target="_top" id="2094480">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094480" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094480/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We hope this post has helped you learn how to curve an image in Photoshop.

In addition, identifying sources for public domain art can be challenging if you are unaware of what these creative works entail.</p><p>Here is a full overview of public domain art, including how to find royalty-free art for your creations.

For example, regardless of the source, you cannot use someone’s street art in your commercial campaigns without their consent. In addition, different artists offer their work under various licenses, each with its unique usage requirements. For example, artwork under the Creative Commons license is free to use for personal and commercial purposes.</p><p>However, not all platforms offer the license information freely. Therefore, here is some information to help you identify royalty-free art you can use for your creative projects.</p><h3 id="So-what-are-public-domain-arts"><a href="#So-what-are-public-domain-arts" class="headerlink" title="So, what are public domain arts?"></a>So, what are public domain arts?</h3><p>Public domain arts are any creation out of copyright, meaning you can use it hassle-free. In addition, public domain arts span various creations, including graffiti, video mash-ups, songs, images, and paintings. Furthermore, most government copyright offices do not list public domain arts on their websites.</p><p>However, the following are the determining factors for work to become public domain.</p><p><strong>The copyright protection is expired</strong></p><p>Any work between 50 and 70 years old after the author’s death is public domain art. However, the copyright expiry can vary between countries. Therefore, familiarize yourself with your country’s copyright policy before using such works.</p><p><strong>The art does not meet the requirements for copyright protection</strong></p><p>In many countries, recipes, facts, and calendar dates do not qualify for copyright protection. However, you can face legal action if they include original descriptions and artwork. For example, reposting the images from last year’s calendar is a violation if a professional photographer does them.</p><p>In addition, some countries do not consider government documents as copyright items. For example, planet photos and videos from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are <a class="link"   href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/index.html" >public domain art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, meaning you can use them freely for commercial and personal creations.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868571/19272" target="_top" id="1868571">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868571" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868571/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="What-is-the-copyright-policy-of-famous-art-in-history"><a href="#What-is-the-copyright-policy-of-famous-art-in-history" class="headerlink" title="What is the copyright policy of famous art in history?"></a>What is the copyright policy of famous art in history?</h3><p>As mentioned above, you cannot rely on copyright websites to determine if your desired art is royalty-free, especially when the artist’s work is unpublished. However, the following tips can be useful in helping you avoid copyright violations. Kindly note that the tips below are for your general knowledge, and you should not rely on them as legal expert advice.</p><ol><li>All work published before January 1st, 1923 is public domain art. However, famous art between 75 and 100 years old may have copyright extensions, which can affect their usage in other projects. Therefore, you should check with the current owner to determine whether they are royalty-free art.</li><li>You can freely use your photo of famous paintings, drawings, and sculptures if they are an exact reproduction of the public domain artwork. This is because you automatically earn the copyright since the photo includes elements of your originality, such as the camera angle and post-production techniques.</li><li>You can not use a third-party photo of public domain art if the resulting image is a derivative. This is because the law recognizes the creator as the author and copyright owner. As such, you must have verifiable permission before using their work in your creations.</li><li>Not all items without a © are in the public domain. This is because modern video editing software allows you to remove copyright symbols from different works. Therefore, always perform a reverse image search when unsure of the photo’s origins.</li></ol><h3 id="Can-you-use-them-for-free"><a href="#Can-you-use-them-for-free" class="headerlink" title="Can you use them for free?"></a>Can you use them for free?</h3><p>Yes. You can use royalty-free art for whatever purpose you see fit. For example, you can reproduce the text and illustrations from the original version of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) because they are in the public domain.</p><p>However, the reproduction of the 1951 version by Walt Disney is a copyright violation since it is a derivative of the original version. In addition, The Walt Disney Company owns the trademark for all the derivatives, including the movie, cartoon characters, and merchandise.</p><h2 id="Part2-Best-Official-Public-Domain-Art-websites-recommendations"><a href="#Part2-Best-Official-Public-Domain-Art-websites-recommendations" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations"></a>Part2: Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations</h2><p>Now that you know what constitutes being in the public domain, where can you find public domain creative assets? Below are recommendations of the best official public domain art websites. Kindly note that the list contains NGO and government sites, some of which may not be accessible in your area.</p><h3 id="1-Public-Domain-Pictures"><a href="#1-Public-Domain-Pictures" class="headerlink" title="1.

In addition, you can easily identify your desired pictures using the categories tab. However, you need to purchase the Premium Download option if you want them in larger resolutions. Furthermore, some royalty-free art may include usage restrictions, which are clearly stated in the image description. For example, you cannot use photos with paid models for offensive campaigns.</p><h3 id="2-Wikimedia-Commons"><a href="#2-Wikimedia-Commons" class="headerlink" title="2. Wikimedia Commons"></a>2.

It hosts over 86 million creative assets from global contributors. In addition, the interface is available in multiple languages, making it accessible to everyone. However, some consider it challenging to use, given the large database. However, the developers offer you recommendations through designated tabs like Valued Images and Featured Pictures. Although most of the content is free to use, you will find images that require you to acknowledge the contributor before using them.</p><h3 id="3-The-New-York-Public-Library-Digital-Collections"><a href="#3-The-New-York-Public-Library-Digital-Collections" class="headerlink" title="3.

In addition, it allows you to only search public domain items by checking the option on the search box.</p><p>Furthermore, the homepage contains different photo collections, which you can access by clicking the category tabs. For example, the <strong>recently digitized</strong> bubble tab gives you access to the most recent photo uploads. However, not all images listed are free to use and may require you to link back to the website. As such, always read the <strong>Rights Statement</strong> at the bottom of the download page to verify the usage requirements.</p><h3 id="4-Flickr-Commons"><a href="#4-Flickr-Commons" class="headerlink" title="4.

However, through their partnership with the Library of Congress in 2008, you can now access thousands of public domain historical photos from institutions like UC Berkeley and the Armenian Studies Program - Fresno State.</p><p>In addition, most of the photos on the Flickr Commons library are listed with <strong>no known copyright restrictions</strong>. Therefore, you can download and use them without fear of any repercussions. Furthermore, the search engine includes multiple filters for more accurate results. For example, you can filter photos by color, orientation, and date.

Here are a few of them to consider.</p><h3 id="1-Artvee-com"><a href="#1-Artvee-com" class="headerlink" title="1.

The platform allows you to search millions of public domain images from some of the world’s top museums, including the Smithsonian and the Met.</p><p>In addition, Artvee.com offers you keyword suggestions depending on user popularity. Alternatively, you can use the Artists tab to locate classical art by specific painters, including Claude Monet and Vincent Van Gogh. Furthermore, you do not need to register an account to use the service. You only need to enter the URL in your browser, narrow down the results using keywords and click download.</p><h3 id="2-Museo"><a href="#2-Museo" class="headerlink" title="2.

Currently, you can access the collections from the following institutions:</p><ul><li>The Harvard Art Museums.</li><li>The Rijksmuseum</li><li>The Art Institute of Chicago.</li><li>The Cleveland Museum of Art.</li><li>The Minneapolis Institute of Art.</li><li>The New York Public Library Collection.</li></ul><p>The above institutions offer open and free API access to their collections, allowing you to download and use them royalty-free. Unfortunately, Museo does not offer an elaborate search engine like Artvee and uses simple keywords to get you results. However, it can work as a decent alternative if you do not want to filter through millions of art pieces.</p><h2 id="FAQ"><a href="#FAQ" class="headerlink" title="FAQ"></a>FAQ</h2><h3 id="Is-there-a-difference-between-royalty-free-art-and-public-domain-art"><a href="#Is-there-a-difference-between-royalty-free-art-and-public-domain-art" class="headerlink" title="Is there a difference between royalty-free art and public domain art?"></a>Is there a difference between royalty-free art and public domain art?</h3><p>Yes. Royalty-free art refers to work that has no recurring payments to the author. However, it may contain usage restrictions depending on the source website. For example, you may need to make a one-time payment to download the image.</p><p>Conversely, public domain art is copyright free and does not require you to make any payments to use it.

For example, planet photos and videos from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are <a class="link"   href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/index.html" >public domain art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, meaning you can use them freely for commercial and personal creations.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/1062447/7443" target="_top" id="1062447">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-1062447" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/1062447/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="What-is-the-copyright-policy-of-famous-art-in-history-1"><a href="#What-is-the-copyright-policy-of-famous-art-in-history-1" class="headerlink" title="What is the copyright policy of famous art in history?"></a>What is the copyright policy of famous art in history?</h3><p>As mentioned above, you cannot rely on copyright websites to determine if your desired art is royalty-free, especially when the artist’s work is unpublished. However, the following tips can be useful in helping you avoid copyright violations. Kindly note that the tips below are for your general knowledge, and you should not rely on them as legal expert advice.</p><ol><li>All work published before January 1st, 1923 is public domain art. However, famous art between 75 and 100 years old may have copyright extensions, which can affect their usage in other projects. Therefore, you should check with the current owner to determine whether they are royalty-free art.</li><li>You can freely use your photo of famous paintings, drawings, and sculptures if they are an exact reproduction of the public domain artwork. This is because you automatically earn the copyright since the photo includes elements of your originality, such as the camera angle and post-production techniques.</li><li>You can not use a third-party photo of public domain art if the resulting image is a derivative. This is because the law recognizes the creator as the author and copyright owner. As such, you must have verifiable permission before using their work in your creations.</li><li>Not all items without a © are in the public domain. This is because modern video editing software allows you to remove copyright symbols from different works. Therefore, always perform a reverse image search when unsure of the photo’s origins.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868575/19272" target="_top" id="1868575">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868575" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868575/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Can-you-use-them-for-free-1"><a href="#Can-you-use-them-for-free-1" class="headerlink" title="Can you use them for free?"></a>Can you use them for free?</h3><p>Yes. You can use royalty-free art for whatever purpose you see fit. For example, you can reproduce the text and illustrations from the original version of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) because they are in the public domain.</p><p>However, the reproduction of the 1951 version by Walt Disney is a copyright violation since it is a derivative of the original version. In addition, The Walt Disney Company owns the trademark for all the derivatives, including the movie, cartoon characters, and merchandise.</p><h2 id="Part2-Best-Official-Public-Domain-Art-websites-recommendations-1"><a href="#Part2-Best-Official-Public-Domain-Art-websites-recommendations-1" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations"></a>Part2: Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations</h2><p>Now that you know what constitutes being in the public domain, where can you find public domain creative assets? Below are recommendations of the best official public domain art websites. Kindly note that the list contains NGO and government sites, some of which may not be accessible in your area.</p><h3 id="1-Public-Domain-Pictures-1"><a href="#1-Public-Domain-Pictures-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

In addition, you can easily identify your desired pictures using the categories tab. However, you need to purchase the Premium Download option if you want them in larger resolutions. Furthermore, some royalty-free art may include usage restrictions, which are clearly stated in the image description. For example, you cannot use photos with paid models for offensive campaigns.</p><h3 id="2-Wikimedia-Commons-1"><a href="#2-Wikimedia-Commons-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Wikimedia Commons"></a>2.

It hosts over 86 million creative assets from global contributors. In addition, the interface is available in multiple languages, making it accessible to everyone. However, some consider it challenging to use, given the large database. However, the developers offer you recommendations through designated tabs like Valued Images and Featured Pictures. Although most of the content is free to use, you will find images that require you to acknowledge the contributor before using them.</p><h3 id="3-The-New-York-Public-Library-Digital-Collections-1"><a href="#3-The-New-York-Public-Library-Digital-Collections-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

In addition, it allows you to only search public domain items by checking the option on the search box.</p><p>Furthermore, the homepage contains different photo collections, which you can access by clicking the category tabs. For example, the <strong>recently digitized</strong> bubble tab gives you access to the most recent photo uploads. However, not all images listed are free to use and may require you to link back to the website. As such, always read the <strong>Rights Statement</strong> at the bottom of the download page to verify the usage requirements.</p><h3 id="4-Flickr-Commons-1"><a href="#4-Flickr-Commons-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

Unfortunately, Museo does not offer an elaborate search engine like Artvee and uses simple keywords to get you results. However, it can work as a decent alternative if you do not want to filter through millions of art pieces.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134500/19576" target="_top" id="2134500">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134500" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134500/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="FAQ-1"><a href="#FAQ-1" class="headerlink" title="FAQ"></a>FAQ</h2><h3 id="Is-there-a-difference-between-royalty-free-art-and-public-domain-art-1"><a href="#Is-there-a-difference-between-royalty-free-art-and-public-domain-art-1" class="headerlink" title="Is there a difference between royalty-free art and public domain art?"></a>Is there a difference between royalty-free art and public domain art?</h3><p>Yes.

The famous camera manufacturer has divided all mirrorless 1-series camera models into three different categories. The entry-level S-series, the midrange J-series, and the high-end V-series. Nikon 1 J5 is the successor to the Nikon’s J4 model and the upgrades introduced with this model go far beyond the visual appearance of the camera. The retro design of the Nikon 1 J5, more than affordable price together with a plethora of photo and video options make this mirrorless camera attractive to photography and video enthusiasts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/nikon-1-j5-review.jpg"                      alt="nikon-1-j5-review"                ></p><h2 id="Nikon-1-J5-Complete-Review"><a href="#Nikon-1-J5-Complete-Review" class="headerlink" title="Nikon 1 J5 Complete Review"></a>Nikon 1 J5 Complete Review</h2><h4 id="1-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#1-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="1. Pros and Cons"></a>1. Pros and Cons</h4><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Quality images</li><li>Excellent burst capabilities</li><li>Built-in WiFi and NFC</li><li>Good noise reduction and excellent ISO performer</li><li>Affordable</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Doesn’t have a viewfinder</li><li>Short battery life</li><li>4K recording at only 15fps</li><li>Only compatible with F-mount lenses</li></ul><h4 id="2-Design"><a href="#2-Design" class="headerlink" title="2. Design"></a>2. Design</h4><p> Nikon 1 J5 is an elegant, compact camera that benefits from its retro design. It is relatively small in size with dimensions of 98.3 x 59.7 x 31.5 mm that make it a perfect companion on daily walks or family vacations. The J5 is available in Silver, Black and White colors and all models have a grip that ensures that camera can be held firmly. Judging by its appearance Nikon 1 J5 could be easily mistaken for an analog photo camera because it is light-weight, small and its faux leather body evokes memories of some of the most memorable Nikon analog cameras. However, the inside of this mid-range compact camera is far removed from its analog predecessors, since it features the latest digital technology that produces high-quality still images and videos.</p><h4 id="3-Sensor-and-Processor"><a href="#3-Sensor-and-Processor" class="headerlink" title="3. Sensor and Processor"></a>3. Sensor and Processor</h4><p> The Nikon 1 J5 has a 1-inch 20.8MP CX-Format BSI CMOS Sensor that may not be the best camera sensor on the market, but with 20.8 million pixels it still has higher resolution than any other J-series camera. The camera’s sensor is efficient at excluding the low-pass filter, which guarantees the remarkable image sharpness. The noise level reduction at high ISO values enhances the camera’s performance in low-light conditions, which means that ISO values can be set as high as 12800 without jeopardizing the quality of the images. The CMOS sensor is paired with the EXPEED 5A Image Processor and together they provide speed and efficiency across the entire camera system.</p><p> The Nikon 1 J5’s hybrid autofocus system has 171 Contrast-Detection points and 105 Phase-Detection points that ensure that the subjects of the photos and videos are always in focus when autofocus feature is on. The camera users can choose between manual focus and several Autofocus modes including Continuous Servo AF (C) and Full-time Servo modes. The Nikon 1 J5’s utilizes only the Nikon F-mount lenses, so those who wish to use some of the legendary DSLR Nikon lenses must do so via the FT1 lens adapter. The camera’s 10-30 mm F3.5-5.6 VR kit lens is equivalent to 27-81 mm focal length range due to the camera’s 2.7 crop factor. The Nikon 1 J5’s in-body image stabilization is only available while recording at 30 or 60p, but the kit lens features Nikon’s lens-based optical stabilization system that ensures that camera shakes are kept to the minimum when working in different camera modes.</p><h4 id="4-Autofocus"><a href="#4-Autofocus" class="headerlink" title="4. Autofocus"></a>4. Autofocus</h4><p> The camera’s 4D focus system further contributes to the clarity and accuracy of the images A6300 produces. The Sony Alpha A6300 4D focus system has 425 on-chip Phase-Detection points as well as 169 Contrast-Detection points that enable the camera to focus the image in 0.05 seconds. The high density of focusing point allows the Tracking AF technology to track moving objects, even in the low-visibility conditions, which can be quite useful when filming outdoor scenes. The more experienced photographers and videographers can benefit from the Peaking MF feature that makes acquiring perfect manual focus much easier. Even though A6300 utilizes only the E-mount lenses the Phase-Detection is enabled on A-mount lenses that can be attached to the camera via LA-EA1 or LA-EA3 lens adapters.</p><h4 id="5-Image-quality"><a href="#5-Image-quality" class="headerlink" title="5. Image quality"></a>5. Image quality</h4><p> The Nikon’s latest J-series midrange compact camera can produce high-resolution photos as well as UHD 4K and Full HD videos. The camera captures UHD 4K video at 2160p, 15fps, while Full HD videos can be captured at 1080p resolution and 60fps in either MOV or MPEG4 formats. The Nikon 1 J5 can take up to 20 continuous 20.8 MP still images, and the photos can be saved as JPEG or RAW files. The largest photo resolution this camera can produce is 5568 X 3712, while users can choose between a number of different aspect ratios. Although Nikon 1 J5 is equipped with a built-in stereo microphone, it doesn’t have an external microphone plug-in, which can make professional sound recording quite difficult. Furthermore, the camera lacks a viewfinder and because of that composing a shot in broad daylight can be a daunting task. Users are forced to use the J5’s 3-inch 1,037K-dot tilting LCD touchscreen. However, the add-on viewfinder can be attached to the camera’s display, but it might take some time to get used to using an external viewfinder.</p><h4 id="6-Controls"><a href="#6-Controls" class="headerlink" title="6. Controls"></a>6. Controls</h4><p> Micro SD, Micro SDHC, and Micro SDXC memory cards can all be used to store the recorded footage that can be easily transferred to other devices via a WiFi or HDMI connection. In order to utilize the built-in SnapBrdge WiFi connectivity feature, the users must first install the Nikon Wireless Mobile Utility app on their iOS or Android Smartphones. Once the app is installed, the users can control the Nikon 1 J5 remotely and have full access to all of the camera’s features as well as to the contents of the SD card. The Near Field Communication enables you to share your images on the internet effortlessly, tag your friends or transfer photos and videos wirelessly. The highest data rate the Nikon 1 J5 can provide is 54 Mbps, while the connection between the camera and another device can be established in a 10-meter radius.</p><p> The Nikon 1 J5 offers a large number of different modes that enable the camera operators to adjust the camera settings to the demands of the scene. Picture control modes, Glamour Retouch modes or Creative modes provide a possibility for visual experimentation and improve the quality of images by enhancing its chromatic values.</p><h4 id="7-Key-features"><a href="#7-Key-features" class="headerlink" title="7.

Conclusion"></a>8. Conclusion</h4><p> The Nikon’s J5 camera is solid video and photography tool that features hardware that makes high-end performance possible even in the low-light situations. The J5 has performed well while recording moving objects, mostly because of its hybrid autofocus system that utilizes both Phase and Contrast Detection Autofocus systems. The Nikon’s latest J-series edition is well-equipped to serve the needs of the less demanding users, but the J5 lacks some of the key features for professional use. Purchasing the Nikon 1 J5 is an excellent choice for beginners and those users who only need a camera to capture important moments in their lives in excellent quality, but professional users would be better off obtaining some of the Nikon’s more advanced models.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-onestream-integration-tips-for-seamless-livestreaming/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved OneStream Integration Tips for Seamless Livestreaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-2024s-most-economical-cloud-stores-revealed/"><u>[New] 2024'S Most Economical Cloud Stores Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/new-audio-capture-mastery-in-windows-10/"><u>[New] Audio Capture Mastery in Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-detailed-review-of-the-sony-fdr-x1000-action-camera-for-2024/"><u>[New] Detailed Review of the Sony FDR-X1000 Action Camera for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-enjoy-9-complete-uncut-holiday-cine-classics-for-no-cost/"><u>[New] Enjoy 9 Complete, Uncut Holiday Cine Classics for No Cost</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-the-secret-sauce-to-swipe-right-crafting-captivating-bio-on-tinder-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Secret Sauce to Swipe Right Crafting Captivating Bio on Tinder for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-digital-dreamscapes-compared-metaverse-vs-omniverse-in-the-limelight-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Digital Dreamscapes Compared Metaverse Vs.

It sets the tone of the entire presentation and helps create a lasting impact on audiences. Not giving any priority to music can be a common mistake for marketers who naturally place more importance on content. Sometimes, these mistakes can cause time constraints and even cost money.

However, do you realize that you can use speech-to-text technology in PowerPoint? Yes! It is effortless and fun-filled: dictate, and create presentable slides with your speech. What is more fun than speaking and seeing your speech in electronic formats? This article teaches how you can create presentations via speech-to-text technology and how you can use real-time translation in PowerPoint.</p><p><strong>Best Speech-To-Text Software</strong> Save plenty of time on transcribing subtitles and boost your editing efficiency by applying Filmora Speech-To-Text to make perfect PPT videos.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make PPT Videos Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make PPT Videos Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Explore STT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-enable-speech-to-text-in-PowerPoint"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-enable-speech-to-text-in-PowerPoint" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to enable speech-to-text in PowerPoint?"></a>Part 1: How to enable speech-to-text in PowerPoint?</h2><p>Using speech-to-text in PowerPoint is the same principle guiding other platforms like Microsoft Words. Also, PowerPoint presentation on a windows device is similar to a Mac. However, some control and key functions differ in the two devices. The only thing you should note when you want to use the speech-to-text function is the type of device you are using. You can enable “speech-to-text” on devices like Mac, Windows, and mobile phones.</p><p>Please note that “enabling speech-to-text” in PowerPoint differs from “using speech-to-text.” For example, you have to enable the speech-to-text first before you can use it. Also, how you enable speech-to-text in PowerPoint is based on the selected devices. Let’s discuss enabling speech-to-text on Mac and Windows.</p><h3 id="Enable-speech-to-text-on-Mac"><a href="#Enable-speech-to-text-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Enable speech-to-text on Mac"></a><strong>Enable speech-to-text on Mac</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Select the control button:</strong> Mac allows you to select the control button for activating speech-to-text the first time you want to use the feature. Unlike other devices, the control option pops up when you select the speech-to-text option. It then displays some control options so that you can select the button suitable for you.</li><li><strong>Activate the feature:</strong> click on the apple logo on your Mac, and select <strong>“system preference.”</strong> Select <strong>“keyboard”</strong> options displayed in the system preference.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-1.jpg"                      alt="click on the apple logo"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Select the dictation option:</strong> select dictation from the keyboard option and check the <strong>“on&#x2F;off”</strong> The option also has an advanced feature that allows additional commands.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-2.jpg"                      alt="select the dictation option"                ></p><p>Once you activate the dictation from the command button, you can use the speech-to-text feature anywhere you can type on Mac - this applies to PowerPoint. However, you may need some tweaking on PowerPoint to finally use the feature as you prepare your slides.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135418/19272" target="_top" id="2135418">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135418" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135418/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Enable-speech-to-text-on-Windows"><a href="#Enable-speech-to-text-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Enable speech-to-text on Windows"></a><strong>Enable speech-to-text on Windows</strong></h3><p>Aside from the regular Cortana speech recognition on Windows, you can use the speech-to-text feature on PowerPoint. PowerPoint supports “speech-to-text” when you use the program; however, activating the Windows device through the <strong>built-in speech recognition</strong> makes the process easy and effective. Some windows PC, just like Mac, lets you first activate the speech recognition function before you proceed and use it on PowerPoint.</p><ul><li>On PowerPoint, click on the microphone icon on the left corner of your PowerPoint’s homepage. If the speech-to-text feature is not activated on your device, you can follow the instruction to activate it. Peradventure you do not have PowerPoint installed on your device, you can activate the dictation feature through the command button or search feature on windows.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-3.jpg"                      alt="click on the microphone icon"                ></p><ul><li>Click on the search button and type <strong>“dictation”</strong> or “<strong>speech services</strong>,” and the device redirects you to settings.

There are cases you need to activate speech-to-text in a life event. PowerPoint supports this through the “speech-to-text” feature available on the platform.</p><h3 id="Set-up-captions-and-subtitles"><a href="#Set-up-captions-and-subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Set up captions and subtitles"></a><strong>Set up captions and subtitles</strong></h3><p>Real-time display and translation are suitable for the multi-language purpose. You can select the real-time option on your PowerPoint and makes it display another subtitle in other languages. Thus, when you speak in a language, the captions or subtitles display another text (speech-to-text) in a different language.</p><ul><li>Click on the <strong>slide show</strong>, and go to <strong>subtitle settings</strong>; select <strong>spoken languages.</strong> The spoken language is the “speech input language”: the language you will speak to be translated.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-8.jpg"                      alt="click on the slide show"                ></p><ul><li>After setting the spoken language, move on to set the <strong>subtitle&#x2F;caption language.</strong> The subtitle or caption language is the translated language. PowerPoint allows you to translate speech without using an application. You can make a multi-language selection without much involvement - just settings.</li></ul><p><strong>Tips:</strong> Many options are available for easy use and accessibility. Aside from the multi-language selection, you can explore the “slide show” settings for better understanding. You may see other options that best illustrate your need for translation in real-time on PowerPoint.</p><p>When you activate the real-time translation on PowerPoint, the settings occur in two stages: slideshow view and presenter view. You can vary the changes based on your view (as the presenter) or what people see (slideshow view).</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-make-speech-to-text-and-translation-to-create-PowerPoint-videos"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-make-speech-to-text-and-translation-to-create-PowerPoint-videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to make speech-to-text and translation to create PowerPoint videos"></a>Part 4: How to make speech-to-text and translation to create PowerPoint videos</h2><p>When you want to make perfect PPT videos, you can use Filmora’s STT feature. Wondershare Filmora Speech to Text is quite different with other STT service providers. Other STT platforms&#x2F;stages require you to use the application to convert speech-to-text, save, and export into other third-party software. However, Wondershare Filmora allows you to directly convert your speech-to-text on an ongoing production. For example, you can convert speech into subtitles during a video production on Wondershare Filmora.</p><p>What’s more, now Filmora’s STT feature supports direct transcription of bilingual subtitles with up to 27 languages of transcription in Filmora version 13.</p><h3 id="Top-Adavantages-of-Filmora-STT"><a href="#Top-Adavantages-of-Filmora-STT" class="headerlink" title="Top Adavantages of Filmora STT"></a>Top Adavantages of Filmora STT</h3><ul><li>Supports direct transcription of bilingual subtitles.</li><li>Allows to transcribe video speech to text in one click.</li><li>Boosts editing efficiency by applying the STT feature.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make PPT Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make PPT Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h3 id="Use-Filmora-STT-to-make-PowerPoint-videos-translation"><a href="#Use-Filmora-STT-to-make-PowerPoint-videos-translation" class="headerlink" title="Use Filmora STT to make PowerPoint videos translation"></a>Use Filmora STT to make PowerPoint videos translation</h3><h5 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Select the audio asset in the timeline, and click the “Speech-to-Text” icon in the toolbar; if there is no supported file type on the timeline, it will not be displayed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/guide-win/toolbar-stt.jpg"                      alt="toolbar stt"                ></p><h5 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Click the “Speech-to-Text” icon, and it will show the parameter settings.

Additionally, several video-sharing platforms encourage artists to share and promote themselves in creative ways. However, how much will it cost to shoot a music video? Below is how you can determine the answer to that.</p><p><strong>Creating a Budget</strong></p><p>The budget for your music video usually covers pre-production, concept development, casting, storyboards, choreography, location fee, rehearsal, production equipment, on-camera talent, props, costumes, post-production, editing, and many more. For a professional video, you can budget anywhere from $20,000 to $500,000. Sometimes, it costs even more, depending on the concept you’re looking to achieve.</p><p>However, if you have a lower budget, you would have to forego the inclusion of high-end visual effects, expensive locations, and many more.

It really doesn’t matter what kind of use you put a camera – creative shots, hands-free convenience, or stationary surveillance. For shots that require slow motion, time-lapses, or simply capturing movement, handling tripods are way too much hassle. And when the times (and shots) are too rocky, they’re just not enough to stabilize and focus.</p><p>For times when you’re on a tight budget or with no room for extra equipment, or if you simply aren’t well versed with complex camera functions but love to shoot, the auto-track camera gives way to your creativity to shine.</p><ol><li><strong>What Is The Price Of A Tracking Camera?</strong></li></ol><p>The price of an auto track camera can widely vary according to the features, quality, brand, and additional accessories that you are looking for. On the lower end, you can get a face-tracking camera for $400. At this low price, you may get a decent camera that auto tracks, but it may also mean a compromise on durability, sensor precision, resolution, and quality, among other things.</p><p>On the higher end, with loaded features, high resolution, flexibility in lenses, sound audio recording, you can expect the price to range between one to a few grand easily.</p><ol><li><strong>Where To Buy An Auto Tracking Camera For Sports?</strong></li></ol><p>It is easy to purchase an auto-tracking camera for sports, thanks to the convenience of online shopping. You can find most of these cameras on sites like Amazon at the standard price set by the manufacturer. Also, there is the official company’s e-commerce page and more affiliate blogs and vendors that you can shop from. If you want to physically buy, you can get them at your nearest electronics showrooms.</p><p>To sum it up, when buying an auto track camera, always consider your needs and uses. Each camera specializes in meeting a set of performance expectations. For instance, vlogging needs better resolution, conferences need more precision, and sports need more movement flexibility. Once you have your priorities sorted, this guide is exhaustive to help you with your buying decision.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-in-depth-review-is-inshot-the-editors-choice/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved In-Depth Review Is InShot The Editor's Choice?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-art-of-aligning-brands-with-youtube-content/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Art of Aligning Brands with YouTube Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-speaking-and-listening-to-create-better-decks/"><u>[New] In 2024, Speaking and Listening to Create Better Decks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-husqvarnas-sky-high-adventure-with-h501s-x4-review/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Husqvarna's Sky-High Adventure with H501S X4 Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/2024-approved-dive-into-av1-a-simple-guide-for-neophytes/"><u>2024 Approved Dive Into AV1 A Simple Guide for Neophytes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/2024-approved-into-the-blueprint-cutting-edge-techniques-for-drones/"><u>2024 Approved Into the Blueprint Cutting-Edge Techniques for Drones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/8-solutions-to-solve-youtube-app-crashing-on-xiaomi-civi-3-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>8 Solutions to Solve YouTube App Crashing on Xiaomi Civi 3 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/best-practices-for-apples-podcast-listings/"><u>Best Practices for Apple's Podcast Listings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/can-t-view-mkv-movies-content-on-htc-u23-pro-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mkv-on-android/"><u>Can’t view MKV movies content on HTC U23 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/how-ai-is-revolutionizing-olympic-sports-and-technology-insights-from-abbyy/"><u>How AI Is Revolutionizing Olympic Sports and Technology: Insights From ABBYY</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-get-the-rare-candy-on-pokemon-go-fire-red-on-realme-c33-2023-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, The Ultimate Guide to Get the Rare Candy on Pokemon Go Fire Red On Realme C33 2023 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/step-by-step-fixes-for-recurrent-microsoft-edge-problems-on-windows-11-systems/"><u>Step-by-Step Fixes for Recurrent Microsoft Edge Problems on Windows 11 Systems</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
