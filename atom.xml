    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Apex-Design-Studio-Examination"><a href="#Apex-Design-Studio-Examination" class="headerlink" title="Apex Design Studio Examination"></a>Apex Design Studio Examination</h2><p> Studio is a video editing program that is currently in its 25th version and has consistently gotten faster and more potent over time. The software’s creator also creates the  video editing program, with  occupying the more expensive end of the market.  It has top-notch editing features and effects including stop-motion video, multicam editing, and motion tracking that are targeted at hobbyists with near-professional skill levels. Thankfully, it doesn’t have the challenging learning curve that comes with professional video editing software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/pinnacle-studio-25.jpg"                      alt="pinnacle studio 25"                ></p><p>The current version’s new features include 8K compatibility, intelligent object tracking, blend modes, and personalized audio noise reduction. Version 24’s face motion tracking with mosaic blur, redesigned title editor, and enhanced keyframe controls are further recent feature updates. Version 23 before it brought several significant new features of its own, such as batch processing, clip nesting, animated GIF creation, color LUT presets, and selectable color vectorscopes.</p><h2 id="Will-your-PC-handle-Studio-25"><a href="#Will-your-PC-handle-Studio-25" class="headerlink" title="Will your PC handle  Studio 25?"></a>Will your PC handle  Studio 25?</h2><p>For UHD, multicam, or 360 video, you’ll need an Intel Core i7 4th generation or later or AMD Athlon A10 or above. You’ll also need at least 4GB RAM, with 8GB being suggested, and Windows 10 (64-bit).</p><p>To get started, you must first download a little installer stub application, after which the large full program is downloaded. You’ll need a quick internet connection and lots of disk space because the download is over 2GB in size and the installation uses up 3.6GB of your hard drive. Of course, a large disk is necessary if you’re editing 4K video. Additionally, MultiCam Capture Lite and MyDVD are installed by the installation.</p><p>When you launch the program for the first time, you’re invited to the User Experience Improvement Program, which transmits anonymous usage data back to the firm; turning that off if you’re not interested is simple. The Import option allows you to record and open media files, a dialog box informs you next.</p><p>It is simple to choose the forms of importing you require, whether it be from a DVD, computer folders, stop- motion, a snapshot, or a multicam, because import occupies the entire application window. The software supports 4K multimedia import, and you may star-rate and keyword-tag video during import to make it easier to find afterwards. By looking for specific words in the filename, the search bar also aids in locating content that hasn’t been designated in this manner.</p><p>MultiCam Capture is one of the options in the Import mode. This launches a third-party application that enables you to record both your computer’s screen and any attached or built-in webcams. You may start and stop recording using function keys, and the tool creates distinct, synchronized clips that you can add to your project bin. The editing interface in  is attractive and versatile. It has a black and gray color scheme with flat, 2D icons. Project Bins are a feature of the program that let you save all the content for a certain movie project, including clips, images, and sound files but excluding effects and transitions.</p><h2 id="What-Blend-Modes-are-there"><a href="#What-Blend-Modes-are-there" class="headerlink" title="What Blend Modes are there?"></a>What Blend Modes are there?</h2><p>Because Blend Modes are so widely used in the business, it was always a somewhat odd that  Studio didn’t actually permit their use prior to this edition. Blend modes are actually a fantastic method to see what makes  unique from the competition.</p><p>The majority of editing programs at this level often have three or four blend options that may be turned on or off, and then we are done. There are 16 distinct Blend Modes in  Studio, each of which has fine intensity control and may also be fully keyframed.</p><p>You may merge masked regions, generate light bleeds, create overlaid effects, and many more color and exposure effects. Each Blend Mode combines the color and brightness values in a selected clip with the values in an underlying clip using a unique complicated formula.</p><h2 id="What-does-Smart-Tracking-mean"><a href="#What-does-Smart-Tracking-mean" class="headerlink" title="What does Smart Tracking mean?"></a>What does Smart Tracking mean?</h2><p>These days, motion tracking is a major deal, and any video editing software worth its salt either already has it or will be adding it shortly. The implementation in  Studio is superb.</p><p>It includes smart masking capabilities that let you pick an item and precisely tweak the selection. The tracking option is automated for you, but it can take some time. If necessary, you have options to edit and fix the tracking later.</p><p>The ability to manipulate the backdrop and mask independently, together with the addition of color correction and other filters, is the next step in developing really original appearances. You can totally eliminate the backdrop with more sophisticated choices, add text layers, or even duplicate the masked object. It’s an effective tool that performs as promised and as anticipated.</p><p>Speaking of masks, those tools have been improved to make object selection simpler. You can now create the best masks using both raster and vector forms. It’s a brilliant idea to use a mask to track an object, as was indicated before. We enjoyed playing around with that function.</p><h2 id="What-versions-of-Studio-25"><a href="#What-versions-of-Studio-25" class="headerlink" title="What versions of  Studio 25"></a>What versions of  Studio 25</h2><p>There are three versions of  Studio: Studio, Studio Plus, and Studio Ultimate. All of them let you work in 8K, albeit the first two have some restrictions. The Ultimate version was examined. Studio, for example, has some color correction capabilities, simple 2-camera editing for multi-camera work, and keyframe controls but only allows you to work over six tracks.</p><p>With 24 tracks, 4 cameras in multi-camera mode, basic motion tracking features, blend mode, an advanced audio editor, and batch processing, Studio Plus ups the ante. Alpha channel support, Smart Object Tracking, 360 Video Editing, and Video Masking are all included in Ultimate.</p><h2 id="What-are-the-benefits-of-Studio-25"><a href="#What-are-the-benefits-of-Studio-25" class="headerlink" title="What are the benefits of  Studio 25?"></a>What are the benefits of  Studio 25?</h2><p>There were already some decent audio editing features in  Studio. The audio part of the timeline may already be expanded, and you could do a lot of your work there, such as adjusting the audio of each layer or switching on keyframing to regulate the levels over time.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-increase-photo-resolution-unaltered-image/"><u>[Updated] Increase Photo Resolution - Unaltered Image</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-maximize-iphone-screen-space-with-smaller-videos/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Maximize iPhone Screen Space with Smaller Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/2024-approved-turning-clutter-into-clarity-managing-massive-tiktok-drafters/"><u>2024 Approved  Turning Clutter Into Clarity  Managing Massive TikTok Drafters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-artists-secret-high-quality-free-text-files/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Artist's Secret  High-Quality Free Text Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-funimate-the-game-changers-manual/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Funimate  The Game Changer's Manual</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-explore-the-finest-5-android-photo-editing-apps/"><u>[Updated] Explore the Finest 5 Android Photo Editing Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/2024-approved-enhance-phantom-flying-top-11-add-on-gear/"><u>2024 Approved  Enhance Phantom Flying  Top 11 Add-On Gear</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-from-individual-tracks-to-albums-building-a-personalized-soundtrack-on-web-and-mobile-for-2024/"><u>[New] From Individual Tracks to Albums  Building a Personalized Soundtrack on Web & Mobile for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-30-pro-windows-10-mastery-hacks/"><u>2024 Approved  Top 30 Pro Windows 10 Mastery Hacks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/planning-to-use-a-pokemon-go-joystick-on-vivo-x90s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Planning to Use a Pokemon Go Joystick on Vivo X90S? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/this-article-discusses-what-is-adobe-premiere-pro-how-to-download-install-and-use-it-and-its-key-features-it-further-discusses-its-alternative-for-editing-y/"><u>This Article Discusses What Is Adobe Premiere Pro, How to Download, Install and Use It, and Its Key Features.

Use <strong>Microsoft speech to text</strong> service. This service was launched in 2020 alongside the text-to-speech service, which includes famous computer-generated voices like <strong>Microsoft Sam</strong> and his brother, Mike. So, in this short read, you’ll learn what <strong>Microsoft Azure speech to text</strong> service is and its capabilities. I’ll also introduce you to the best Microsoft Azure STT alternatives. Let’s hunker down!</p><p><strong>Top Alternative to Microsoft Azure STT</strong> Save plenty of time on transcribing subtitles and boost your editing efficiency by applying Filmora Speech-To-Text.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try STT Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try STT Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Explore STT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Microsoft-Azure-and-Speech-Studio"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Microsoft-Azure-and-Speech-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Microsoft Azure and Speech Studio?"></a>Part 1: What is Microsoft Azure and Speech Studio?</h2><p>Microsoft Azure STT and TTS are part of <strong>Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech</strong>. These cognitive services feature state-of-the-art intelligence covering voice recognition, speaker recognition, machine translation, and OCR (Optical Character Recognition). The Microsoft speech to text service uses Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) to auto-recognize, analyze, and convert human voices to editable and searchable texts.</p><p>Having said that, Azure STT lets you transcribe streaming audio, microphone commentary, or local audio files. It supports 100+ languages, including English, German, French, Swahili, Hindi, Ukrainian, Turkish, Arabic, and more. Remember that this service also supports batch transcription, allowing you to transcribe multiple audios in batch.</p><p>In the meantime, Azure STT is available in many formats, including Speech SDK. Speech SDK (Software Development Kit) allows you to use popular programming languages to create a speech-enabled application. It’s compatible with Java, JavaScript, Python, Visual Studio C++, Swift, and Objective-C.</p><p>If you’re not good with programming languages, use Speech CLI, a command tool that allows you to use the speech recognition service without entering a code. Put simply, it features a minimal setup with precise requirements. Plus, it features pretty much everything you’ll find in Speech SDK. So, it depends on your skills and preference.</p><p>It is also worth noting that Azure Speech Studio supports keyword recognition or keyword spotting. You can generate keyword recognition models and specify any short phrase or word. Users can also personalize keywords with the correct punctuations. And best of all, there is no extra cost for customizing keywords.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Transcribe-Speech-to-Text-with-Microsoft-Speech-Studio"><a href="#Part-2-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Transcribe-Speech-to-Text-with-Microsoft-Speech-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Step by Step Guide to Transcribe Speech to Text with Microsoft Speech Studio"></a>Part 2: Step by Step Guide to Transcribe Speech to Text with Microsoft Speech Studio</h2><p>Now let’s learn how to use Microsoft Azure speech recognition services. Remember, the conversion may not be accurate if the audio has lots of domain-industry jargon or ambient noises. Therefore, use crisp-clear audio with an external mic or train the software to recognize specific words or keywords. Let’s get started!</p><p>Step1Start by creating a Microsoft Azure account. You’ll start with the free version, which gives you a <strong>$200 credit to use within 30 days</strong>. After depleting the free credits, use the pay-as-you-go model, which unlocks 40+ Azure services.</p><p>Step2After creating a Microsoft Azure portal, you’ll see all Azure services. Click the Speech Services tab or search for “speech services” on the search bar. Now click Create and then fill out the project details. Then, click Review and Create before clicking Create.</p><p>Step3The program will take a while to deploy an instance. Now tap Keys and endpoints on the left pane and copy the key and region identifier as you may need them later on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/microsoft-speech-to-text-1.jpg"                      alt="micrsoft azure speech to text copy key and region"                ></p><p>Step4Download and install Microsoft Visual C++ and .NET Core 3.1 Runtime. Next, install Speech CL on .NET by running this command “**dotnet tool install -global Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.CLI.**” Alternatively, download and install Speech CLI for Windows PCs as a <a class="link"   href="https://aka.ms/speech/spx-windows" >ZIP file <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Step5Now enter the Azure regional identifier and subscription key on Windows Terminal or PowerShell. To configure the region and key, run these commands; “<strong>spx config @key –set SUBSCRIPTION-KEY</strong> and **spx config @region –set REGION.**”</p><p>Step6Now it’s time to convert speech to text using Azure STT Service. To do that, run “<strong>spx recognize -microphone</strong>” on Terminal or PowerShell. Azure Speech CLI will listen to sound input and convert it to text. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                      alt="icon note"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Click <a class="link"   href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/one-dev-minute/how-to-use-the-azure-cognitive-services-net-speech-sdk-for-recognition" >this video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a detailed guide on how to use Azure Speech Services with Visual Basic (SDK).</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Are-the-Free-Alternatives-to-the-Microsoft-Speech-to-Text-Service"><a href="#Part-3-What-Are-the-Free-Alternatives-to-the-Microsoft-Speech-to-Text-Service" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Are the Free Alternatives to the Microsoft Speech to Text Service?"></a>Part 3: What Are the Free Alternatives to the Microsoft Speech to Text Service?</h2><p>We should all agree that using Microsoft Azures Speech Service is not a walk in the park. You need some knowledge of programming and Windows Command Prompt. Even worse, you’ll have to pay each time you want to convert speech to text after depleting the free credits.</p><p>Fortunately, there’s no shortage of free speech to text converters for beginners. So, in this part, we’ll discuss some free Microsoft Azure STT alternatives for beginners.</p><h3 id="1-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#1-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1. Wondershare Filmora"></a>1. Wondershare Filmora</h3><p>Let’s start with the best offline speech-to-text converter for macOS and Windows systems - Filmora. It’s a video editor for creating award-winning videos without prior editing skills. Just upload your local video and edit it as you please. And yes, it works with a host of video formats.</p><p>When you want to make perfect videos, you can use Filmora’s STT feature. Wondershare Filmora Speech to Text is quite different with other STT service providers.

Most of you may not be aware that Google Docs can accurately convert speech to text. This makes it a handy tool if you find speaking easier than writing. As expected, this voice transcription tool recognizes hundreds of languages, like English, French, Italian, Hindi, etc.</p><p>But although it does a commendable job, less-than-clear audio won’t give you accurate transcriptions. Also, it doesn’t feature niceties like periods, commas, and other punctuations. As such, stick to a professional app like Filmora to transcribe your audio to text.</p><p>Steps to convert voice to text with Google Docs:</p><p>Step1Open a new document on Google Docs and then click Voice typing. The inbuilt microphone will automatically launch.</p><p>Step2Next, click the language drop-down arrow on the microphone to choose the transcription language. You can dictate texts in English, Espanol, French, Italian, Afrikaans, Arabic, and more.</p><p>Step3Click the Microphone icon to start dictating texts on Google Docs. After dictating enough texts, tap the red Microphone icon and edit your text. It’s that simple!</p><h3 id="3-Audtext"><a href="#3-Audtext" class="headerlink" title="3. Audtext"></a>3.

It’s a highly rated online program that uses cutting-edge machine learning technology to transcribe audio to text in 60+ languages. You can easily train this program to identify the speaker in your interview or podcast file.</p><p>Meanwhile, Audtext can transcribe typical video and audio formats, including MP3, WAV, M4A, MP4, MOV, and more. And after transcribing audio to text, exploit the inbuilt text editor to retouch and make your text presentable.</p><p>Let’s find out how this STT service works:</p><p>Step1Create a transcription account on Audtext and click New Upload to choose the transcription mode. You can select the automatic transcription that uses AI or professional real-human transcription. So, let’s choose Automatic.</p><p>Step2Drag-n-drop your video or audio file on the program and then choose the transcription language. After adding your file, click Upload to scan and transcribe it. This should take a while.</p><p>Step3Finally, click the transcribed text file to edit it with new texts and punctuations on the inbuilt editor. You can export your transcription in .txt, .srt, or .docx formats. Directly export to Google Drive is also available.</p><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Up to this point, you should be ready to get started with the <strong>Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech</strong>. The speech-to-text feature allows you to convert unlimited voices to text on your computer. However, the program can be challenging to set up if you’re not a techie.</p><p>In that case, use a more straightforward option like Google Docs to dictate texts on the text editor.

The top portion of this player is designed with a metal sheet that provide a nice texture but rest of the body is coated with simple black plastic material , it may appear tacky to most of users.</p><p> Although, Panasonic DMP-UB900 is also designed with black plastic coating but it possesses an eye catching mirrored finish. Further, you will not be able to find any display on this device and it indicates everything via LEDs. As there is no screen to let your know about loading speed and other activities so you can simply keep on waiting with frustration. Backside of UBD-K8500 consists of few essential plugs like twin HDMI sockets, digital optical output, Ethernet and power.</p><p> Remote control of this Samsung player is compact and easy to handle with direction keys and a central select button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/k8500-1.jpg"                                     ></p><h2 id="Connections-and-Control"><a href="#Connections-and-Control" class="headerlink" title="Connections and Control"></a>Connections and Control</h2><p> Samsung UBD-K8500 is designed with sleek appearance having slight curve on rear as well as front portion. The black brushed metal finish make its design pretty good whereas body is actually designed with metal so you may find it highly durable. This player offers reasonably silent operation but you may find that disc tray little noisy and you can clearly feel its motion while moving in and out. A fan is available at rear portion of player that also makes audible noise. The overall weight of UBD-K8500 is 1.9 Kg with total dimension of 406x45x230mm.</p><p> The front side of player consists of an angled lip whereas the right portion possesses a touch sensitive type power, play&#x2F;pause, stop and eject button. The LED indicators will help to indicate the power On function. It doesn’t consist of a display screen on front side but it is not a drawback rather it helps users to enjoy better view in darker rooms. In case if you need any information about current playback then you simply need to press the info button available on remote control; as soon as you press, all details will be displayed on screen. The middle section of device contains a USB port and on left side you will avail a disc tray.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/k8500-2.jpg"                                     ></p><h2 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h2><p> The most important feature of UBD-K8500 is its picture quality for 4K Blu-ray player. If we talk about the fine details then its colour information is stunning enough while native 4K disc edge offers fast Amazon and Netflix connectivity. The 4K HDR ability re-writes the AV setup options so one cannot use traditional test patterns for its image balancing while viewing HDR content. The best trick is to navigate as per player modes as it consists of a coupled HDR input mode that ensures perfect integrity of HDR signal.</p><p> There are numbers of picture modes within tools menu as like User, Movie, Standard and Dynamic. Most of the users may think about Movie mode as their first preference for quality results but the tests show that lots of important audio information is lost during this mode. In case of standard settings, you will be able to avail better subtitle detailing however, contrast and brightness options are equally good in Movie mode. In simple words, selection of right mode highly depends upon user needs and options to make compromises.</p><p> Now, here is one important thing to note that if you try to watch standard blu-ray content with same HDMI input and same content settings then image will naturally get degraded. This happens due to unwanted scaling of image. The best way to get your desired output level is to make adjustments for user settings of this player. It will help you to develop better results for 1080p Blu-ray content but note that switching between viewing modes like this will become complicated if you are not able to remember right disc formats.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/k8500-3.jpg"                                     ></p><h2 id="Verdict"><a href="#Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Verdict"></a>Verdict</h2><p> In simple words, Samsung UBD-K8500 is one of the best devices for your Ultra HD TV needs. It possesses a comprehensive set of all good features with an easy to operate package. You may find its fan and disc tray little noisy but the simple to use interface and stunning remote control abilities again create remarkable results.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="2-Ways-to-Fade-Audio-in-Ableton"><a href="#2-Ways-to-Fade-Audio-in-Ableton" class="headerlink" title="2 Ways to Fade Audio in Ableton"></a>2 Ways to Fade Audio in Ableton</h2><p>As a result of its distinctive method of loop-based composition, Ableton live fades are favorite among hip-hop and electronic music producers. Ableton Live is one of the greatest DAWs to learn if you’re just beginning to make beats or write songs. For many artists, Ableton Live has emerged as the preferred setting for writing music with an eye on live performance. If you’re coming from a conventionally built digital audio workstation, Live’s approach to composition and arrangement is undoubtedly odd.</p><p>One of the most user-friendly pieces of music software ever created is Ableton Live. With a little instruction, you can quickly master Ableton fade and produce recordings of studio-caliber. Since then, Ableton has emerged as one of the top names in electronic music production. Live is a robust DAW with mature capabilities that can be used to produce any kind of music, although it works especially well with certain processes. Follow this guide to learn about Ableton fade in detail.</p><h2 id="Part-1-2-Ways-to-Fade-audio-in-Ableton"><a href="#Part-1-2-Ways-to-Fade-audio-in-Ableton" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. 2 Ways to Fade audio in Ableton"></a>Part 1. 2 Ways to Fade audio in Ableton</h2><p>You’ve certainly heard the terms “audio fade-in” and “audio fade-out” a few times as a newbie, and you may be wondering what they mean and how you might apply them to your films. Crossfading clips on the same track is easier and only needs one track, however crossfading clips on different tracks allows you to apply independent audio effects processing and gives greater flexibility in structuring the fade curves. Both strategies may be helpful for organizing and creating sounds.</p><h3 id="Way-1-Use-Warp-Fades"><a href="#Way-1-Use-Warp-Fades" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Use Warp&#x2F;Fades"></a>Way 1. Use Warp&#x2F;Fades</h3><p>To avoid any clicks, turn on Create Fades on Clip Edges in the Record&#x2F;Warp&#x2F;Launch section of Live’s Preferences. The beginning and ending of the Clip will each have a little fade.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-fades-warp-fades.jpg"                      alt="create fades warp fades"                ></p><p>You must disable the automated mode in order to alter the clip fades. You may accomplish this by doing the following:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/disable-automated-mode-ableton.jpg"                      alt="disable automated mode ableton"                ></p><p>The fade-in and fade-out handles should display when you hover the mouse icon over the audio clip you want to fade. In case, if they don’t, hit ‘A’ on your keyboard to make them appear. Then, you hold down the mouse button while left-clicking on the handle you wish to fade and lowering the fader.</p><h3 id="Way-2-Using-the-MIDI-Track"><a href="#Way-2-Using-the-MIDI-Track" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Using the MIDI Track"></a>Way 2. Using the MIDI Track</h3><p>In the method 2, you can use it on MIDI track. It will load the Utility effect to the specified MIDI track wherever you drag it on the track. Left-click on the little box in the bottom right corner of the DAW to view the Utility effect on your track. Follow the procedure below to do so.<br>Live’s ability to easily clean up the beginning and conclusion of audio samples has long been one of its strengths. Simply hit A and hover over the clip to check sure Automation Mode isn’t turned on. There are two handles you may drag on the left and right, as well as two curve adjusters:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/midi-track-ableton.jpg"                      alt="midi track ableton"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Alternative-way-to-Fade-Audio-without-Ableton"><a href="#Part-2-Alternative-way-to-Fade-Audio-without-Ableton" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="A-Review-Best-Text-Plugins-For-Your-After-Effects-Projects"><a href="#A-Review-Best-Text-Plugins-For-Your-After-Effects-Projects" class="headerlink" title="A Review: Best Text Plugins For Your After Effects Projects"></a>A Review: Best Text Plugins For Your After Effects Projects</h2><p>Adobe After Effects remains one of the most powerful ways to edit videos. One of the main reasons users find it so useful is the ability to customize the video editing process by adding different kinds of plugins to the program. If you are looking to add unique and fancy text to the video you are working on, then these text plugins for After Effects will come in handy.</p><h2 id="TextDelay"><a href="#TextDelay" class="headerlink" title="TextDelay"></a>TextDelay</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://www.toolfarm.com/buy/plugin%5Feverything%5Ftextdelay/" >https://www.toolfarm.com/buy/plugin%5Feverything%5Ftextdelay/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>TextDelay is a native plugin, meaning that you will find it already installed on After Effects. As the name suggests, you can use TextDelay to delay any other text transformations that you may add to the text and it allows you to delay these transformations by word, line, or even character. It comes with a range selector that allows you to have precise control over which characters can get the effect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/text-delay-plugin.jpg"                      alt="text delay plugin"                ></p><h2 id="TextExploder"><a href="#TextExploder" class="headerlink" title="TextExploder"></a>TextExploder</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://aescripts.com/textexploder/" >https://aescripts.com/textexploder/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>TextExploder is an After Effects plugin that is developed by MamoWorld and it allows you to split the text layers in After Effects into words, lines, characters, and more. These splits are so powerful that you can very easily isolate a single word or even a single letter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/text-exploder-plugin.jpg"                      alt="text exploder plugin"                ></p><h2 id="iExpressions-2"><a href="#iExpressions-2" class="headerlink" title="iExpressions 2"></a>iExpressions 2</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://aescripts.com/iexpressions/" >https://aescripts.com/iexpressions/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you want to effectively use the After Effects expressions even if you are not familiar with coding, iExpressions 2 is the text plugin to consider. It comes with 22 ready-to-use iExpressions that you can easily customize to fit into your project and it is so easy to use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/iexpression-2-plugin.jpg"                      alt="iexpression 2 plugin"                ></p><h2 id="TextBox"><a href="#TextBox" class="headerlink" title="TextBox"></a>TextBox</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://aescripts.com/textbox/" >https://aescripts.com/textbox/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you want to create the perfect shape behind your text, then TextBox is a good text plugin to consider. This is a native After Effects plugin, meaning that you will not need to install it and the shapes it creates can be very easily customized. It updates the shapes you create automatically and adds them to the text layer, making it the most ideal solution to create closed captions, lower thirds, and subtitles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/text-box-plugin.jpg"                      alt="text box plugin"                ></p><h2 id="Font-Manager"><a href="#Font-Manager" class="headerlink" title="Font Manager"></a>Font Manager</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://aescripts.com/font-manager/" >https://aescripts.com/font-manager/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Font Manager is an After Effects text plugin that is useful when creating and working with animated typefaces. You can use it to create the most complex animated text graphics in just a few simple clicks. You will also find it very familiar to use as the user interface is similar to the Character Panel in After Effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/font-manager-plugin.jpg"                      alt="font manager plugin"                ></p><h2 id="Cartoon-Moblur"><a href="#Cartoon-Moblur" class="headerlink" title="Cartoon Moblur"></a>Cartoon Moblur</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://www.toolfarm.com/buy/plugin%5Feverything%5Fcartoon%5Fmoblur" >https://www.toolfarm.com/buy/plugin%5Feverything%5Fcartoon%5Fmoblur <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>This is the most ideal plugin to choose when you want to add motion trail to the graphics in your video, but you want them to appear very cartoony. If you have used the motion blur effect in After Effects, Cartoon Moblur will behave in a similar function, but it is more suited to 2D, flat or minimal graphics. Some of the factors that you can customize include the length of the blur (shutter angle), color, and opacity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/cartoon-moblur-plugin.jpg"                      alt="cartoon moblur plugin"                ></p><h2 id="Shadow-Studio"><a href="#Shadow-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Shadow Studio"></a>Shadow Studio</h2><p>If you are looking for shadow styles that will go very well with your project, Shadow Studio is a good plugin to get. It offers you a wide variety of shadow styles including radial, inner, soft, and long shadows. Most people find it an easier and more affordable way to add soft shadows as compared to traditional methods like raytracing. It is also quite easy to use, meaning that shadow effects that would take hours to complete can be done in a matter of minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/shadow-studio-plugin.jpg"                      alt="shadow studio plugin"                ></p><h2 id="Texts-Animation-Bundle"><a href="#Texts-Animation-Bundle" class="headerlink" title="Texts Animation Bundle"></a>Texts Animation Bundle</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://aedownload.com/download-texts-animation-bundle-free-videohive/" >https://aedownload.com/download-texts-animation-bundle-free-videohive/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>This is a bundle of more than 80 different templates to add text effects to any text in After Effects. All the templates in the bundle are easily customizable and the plugin is very easy to use, allowing you to create amazing text effects in just a few clicks. The templates are modeled from various titles, quotes, and stories, so there is a little bit of something for everyone. Plus, the bundle gets constant updates and you are likely to get new templates with each update.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/texts-animation-bundle-plugin.jpg"                      alt="texts animation bundle plugin"                ></p><h2 id="Artificial-Intelligence-Titles"><a href="#Artificial-Intelligence-Titles" class="headerlink" title="Artificial Intelligence Titles"></a>Artificial Intelligence Titles</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://videohive.net/item/ait-artificial-intelligence-titles/22124640?s_rank=1" >https://videohive.net/item/ait-artificial-intelligence-titles/22124640?s%5Frank=1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The Artificial Intelligence Titles is an After Effects text plugin that is designed to be the ultimate typographical solution. Once you have it in After Effects, you can enter any text and the plugin will automatically adjust the entire layout of the text. You can choose to create awesome text boxes, change the color, add special effects and even change the duration, speed, size, and positioning of the text. It also allows users to customize the text animation’s direction without using a keyframe.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/artificial-intelligence-titles-plugin.jpg"                      alt="artificial intelligence titles plugin"                ></p><h2 id="Text-Library"><a href="#Text-Library" class="headerlink" title="Text Library"></a>Text Library</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://videohive.net/item/text-library-handy-text-animations/21932974" >https://videohive.net/item/text-library-handy-text-animations/21932974 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>This is another great text animation bundle with different options for just about any kind of project. But unlike other plugin bundles that only have a few effects to choose from, Text Library has thousands of templates to choose from. Once you have selected the template that you would like to use, you also get the option to customize the template to suit your project. You can customize the text, size, duration of the animation, and color. It is easy to use and is constantly updated to introduce even more templates with each update.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/text-library-plugin.jpg"                      alt="text library plugin"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>On its own After Effects comes with so many post-production effects and features to make your project appear professional and well made. But if you would like to have a unique video production that stands head and shoulders above all others, plugins are a great way to do that. The good news is that After Effects allows for the use of plugins developed by third-party developers and some of the them like the text plugins, we have listed above can be very useful to a video’s production.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or

Not only can you record high quality videos on the spur of the moment, you can set your smartphone up on a tripod mount and shoot planned footage like vlog entries. If you are using one of the most recent models of smartphone then you might not even need a compact digital camera anymore.</p><p>Even though most new smartphone cameras are good, some are still better than others. The three smartphones with the best cameras are ranked later in this article. First, here is an explanation of why they were chosen.</p><h2 id="3-Best-Smartphones-for-Recording-Video-1"><a href="#3-Best-Smartphones-for-Recording-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="3 Best Smartphones for Recording Video"></a>3 Best Smartphones for Recording Video</h2><p>To judge whether a smartphone camera is keeping up with technology there are two main things to watch for. Can it record 4K video and does it have Optical Image Stabilization?</p><h4 id="1-What-does-4K-mean"><a href="#1-What-does-4K-mean" class="headerlink" title="1.What does 4K mean?"></a>1.What does 4K mean?</h4><p>The term 4K refers to the resolution of a video. Having a higher resolution means having more pixels, and the more pixels there are the clearer the image will be. The resolution for an HD video is 1080p, and 4K has about four times more pixels. It is the highest resolution currently possible and all of the best smartphone cameras can record in 4K.</p><p>Not all smartphones that can record in 4K are capable of playing your videos back at that same resolution. Neither are a lot of television and computer screens, since it is still new technology. Computers and t.vs that can play 4K video are becoming more affordable and more popular, though, so it is still worth investing in a phone that shoots in 4K. It is likely the way of the future.</p><h4 id="2-What-is-‘Optical-Image-Stabilization’"><a href="#2-What-is-‘Optical-Image-Stabilization’" class="headerlink" title="2.What is ‘Optical Image Stabilization’?"></a>2.What is ‘Optical Image Stabilization’?</h4><p>Optical Image Stabilization, or OIS, is hardware that helps reduce camera shake. If you are walking around while recording with your phone then having OIS will dramatically reduce the impact of your footsteps or your hands shaking. OIS also helps record sharper images without the help of software.</p><p>While recording on a phone that has OIS it is still a good idea to use a stabilizer, such as a selfie stick, to make sure that your videos are perfectly smooth. However if you are recording spontaneously or need to be able to walk around freely while you record then OIS is a great safety net. It will not cut out all camera shake, but it will reduce it considerably.</p><p>Here are the top three phones for smartphone videographers. All of these phones can record in 4K and have OIS.</p><h4 id="3-Best-smartphones-for-recording-video"><a href="#3-Best-smartphones-for-recording-video" class="headerlink" title="3.Best smartphones for recording video"></a>3.Best smartphones for recording video</h4><p><strong>Second Runner Up – The iPhone 6S Plus</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-iphone.jpg"                      alt="smartphone iphone"                ></p><p>The 6S does not have OIS – it is a Plus-only update. Besides recording in 4K the 6S Plus has a screen that can play videos in 4K. Most televisions and computer monitors still cannot do that, so an iPhone 6S Plus might be your best chance to watch 4K videos.</p><p><strong>First Runner Up – The Google Nexus 6P</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smartphone-google.jpg"                      alt="smartphone google"                ></p><p>The 6P records sharp, clear, videos even in low light. The 6P is even hermetically sealed so you can record video underwater. For still photos, the 6P gives you the option of shooting RAWs instead of jpegs. The benefit of RAW images is that they are more detailed so you have more flexibility while editing. This will be useful if you want to take photos to use in a time lapse video on your phone.</p><p><strong>First Place – The Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus</strong></p><p>Many smartphones have a great main camera and a front camera that is only decent. The Edge Plus has two great cameras. Its main camera can record 4K video, and its front camera can record 2K video. One upgrade from the Edge is that the front camera also has a wider frame.</p><p>The Edge Plus not only records excellent quality video, it also has a microphone that can record decent audio. An external mic is still better, but if you are set on getting by without one then the Edge Plus might be your best bet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/revamp-photos-iphoneandroids-top-sticker-adorning-software/"><u>Revamp Photos  IPhone/Android’s Top Sticker Adorning Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/exploring-high-resolution-with-lgs-digital-cinema-31mu97-b/"><u>Exploring High-Resolution with LG's Digital Cinema 31MU97-B</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-enhancements-in-windows-11-unveiled/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Enhancements in Windows 11 Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/2024-approved-iphone-nightscape-techniques-unlocked/"><u>2024 Approved  IPhone Nightscape Techniques Unlocked</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/2024-approved-spirited-speeches-how-to-make-instagram-text-come-alive/"><u>2024 Approved  Spirited Speeches  How to Make Instagram Text Come Alive</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mastery-of-spotify-ad-formats-and-best-practices/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mastery of Spotify Ad Formats and Best Practices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-the-noobs-manual-to-saving-streaming-radio-lines-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Noob's Manual to Saving Streaming Radio Lines for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-capturing-the-cloud-proven-methods-for-perfecting-drones-in-post-production/"><u>[New] In 2024, Capturing the Cloud  Proven Methods for Perfecting Drones in Post-Production</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-expert-tips-for-smooth-video-trimming-in-photos/"><u>[Updated] Expert Tips for Smooth Video Trimming in Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/2024-approved-adaptability-and-agility-key-attributes-for-thriving-in-a-changing-market-landscape/"><u>2024 Approved  Adaptability & Agility  Key Attributes for Thriving in a Changing Market Landscape</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-effortless-audio-conversion-top-rated-software-options/"><u>Updated In 2024, Effortless Audio Conversion Top-Rated Software Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-location-on-facebook-dating-for-your-oppo-find-x6-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Change Location On Facebook Dating for your Oppo Find X6 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/in-2024-facebook-story-complete-guide-what-is-it-and-how-to-use-it/"><u>In 2024, Facebook Story Complete Guide  What Is It and How to Use It?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-life360-learn-how-everything-works-on-honor-x50i-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Life360 Learn How Everything Works On Honor X50i | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mastering-multimedia-posts-multiphotograph-and-video-uploads-on-instagram/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Mastering Multimedia Posts  Multiphotograph & Video Uploads on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-exploring-imovies-automated-size-control/"><u>[New] Exploring iMovie's Automated Size Control</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/in-2024-beginners-guide-to-pro-youtube-tech/"><u>In 2024, Beginner's Guide to Pro YouTube Tech</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-vivo-s17-pro-location-by-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Track Vivo S17 Pro Location by Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/updated-10-best-free-luts-roundup-download-links-galore/"><u>[Updated] 10 Best Free LUTs Roundup -

Read this section to find out the easy and simple instructions to add a motion blur in Photoshop:</p><p>Step1 First, download and install the Photoshop tool on your PC. Upload your picture and navigate to the “Layers” tab. If you are a Windows user, then press “Ctrl + J” to copy the layer. For MacBook, press “Command+ J”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/motion-blur-to-photos-2.jpg"                      alt="duplicate the layer"                ></p><p>Step2 Now head to the “Filter” section and locate the option called “Blur.” From the drop-down menu, select “Radial Blur.” From the new window, adjust the amount to 10 and choose “Spin” in the “Blur Method” section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/motion-blur-to-photos-3.jpg"                      alt="adjust the radial blur settings"                ></p><p>Step3 Under the “Quality” section, select “Best.” Once done, click on the “OK” button. Wait for some time until the changes get saved. Now head back to the Layer section and tap on the “Vector Mask” option given below. Afterward, select the “Brush” tool from the left side.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/motion-blur-to-photos-4.jpg"                      alt="choose the brush tool"                ></p><p>Step4 Now head to the “Flow” option displayed above and decrease the flow percentage to 50. Also, choose a black color for the foreground. Now, using the “Brush,” press on some of the areas of the face to add some depth of field.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/motion-blur-to-photos-5.jpg"                      alt="adjust the flow percentage to 50"                ></p><p>Step5 Head back to the layer section and select the bottom layer.

Afterward, head to the “Filter” tab and locate the option called “Blur.” From the drop-down menu, tap on “Motion Blur.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/motion-blur-to-photos-6.jpg"                      alt="choose the motion blur"                ></p><p>Step6 Now set the angle on the displayed window and adjust the distance to 200 pixels.
