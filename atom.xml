Students and teachers all agree on using video as a teaching tool. The availability of free and high-quality videos online also makes the perfect addition to mixed learning environments.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/863039/11832" target="_top" id="863039"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-863039"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/video-lecture.jpg"                      alt="video lecture"                ></p><p>Due to the pandemic, we can’t go back to school and teach our students face-to-face; the best option we need to do is to show create and personalized video for the class. Of course, as teachers, we also need the creativity to do the videos for our students.</p><p>Video in education can help the Teachers and Students as well.</p><ul><li>Teachers can find, share, and use some videos that someone else has made.</li><li>Teachers can create their videos using a camera, phone, or maybe a screencast.</li><li>Teachers can host a video conference for the class and the school.</li><li>Knowing how the teacher discusses the lesson allows the students to create their videos.</li></ul><p>The two options for sharing videos with your students are synchronous or asynchronous.</p><p><strong>Synchronous Videos -</strong> it could be a live stream or an interactive video conference. It depends on the school if they want to use Zoom or Google Meet for their classes. We can record synchronous videos for the students so they can view them later if they request. It is helpful and valuable for the students if they can’t attend the live stream or, we can say, online class because of technical issues or important events they need to follow.</p><p>Some schools find that synchronous videos are a great way to keep the students connected. But there’s a problem with privacy issues nowadays, especially with the students if they are shown in synchronous videos and recorded. Make sure you need the student’s permission to record the video. We don’t also forget the internet connection issues of some students. Don’t forget and take note of that.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BBusiness%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/business-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/synchronous-videos-lecture.jpg"                      alt="synchronous videos lecture"                ></p><p><strong>Asynchronous Videos -</strong> you need to record videos that can be viewed and reviewed by the students. Your videos could be a recorded activity using a mobile phone or a screencast for them to know the lesson on that day. Screencasting is where you narrate a video recording or explain the task to your students using your computer screen. It’s up to the teacher if they want to use audio, or you can also see your face in the video.</p><p>Asynchronous learning can be more convenient for the students and allows them to learn anytime they want and place wherever they are. It can also be challenging for teachers to know whether students watched the videos or engaged with the work. We don’t know if the students watched the videos or learned something in the videos. So, double-check it, teacher time to time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296985&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/9cea886b9f44a3c2df1163730ab64994/products/copy_nero_burning_rom_cart.png"                      border="0"                ><br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-video-class.jpg"                      alt="online video class"                ></p><p>Using videos in online classes or classrooms has many benefits and can be adapted for any learning objective. You might find it helpful to use synchronous and asynchronous videos simultaneously. Research continues to provide more insights on how to better utilize video in online classes or classrooms.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Different-ways-to-use-video-in-Online-Classes"><a href="#Different-ways-to-use-video-in-Online-Classes" class="headerlink" title="Different ways to use video in Online Classes"></a>Different ways to use video in Online Classes</h2><p><strong>Keep your videos short</strong></p><p>More effective if the videos you created are shorter. 12 to 15 minutes is the maximum time for the higher students (high school level) and 8 to 10 minutes for the younger students (elementary level). So, try to keep your videos as short as possible while addressing the central concept of the lesson. If you want to use a longer video, break it into smaller segments. Explain to the students the topics and the sub-topics of the lessons. You can divide it into the number of days you need to discuss that lesson.</p><p><strong>Choose suitable videos</strong></p><p>Some video elements are there to entertain and serve no educational purposes. Just avoid the videos with a noise like bells, whistles, or any background music to distract the students from the point of learning. Double-check everything you put into your video to ensure that it is suitable for the ears of the students.</p><p><strong>Video Watching with the students</strong></p><p>Thanks to YouTube, we have to find some content to add to our lessons and become part of the learning sequences of our classes. Add at least just 5 minutes to make sure your class time is not compromised. This type of learning will help the students before, during, or even after watching the videos, leading to outstanding learning outcomes.</p><p>Some activities will help the students to correct their overconfidence about how much they have learned from watching a video. You can add some pop-up questions throughout a video or give them an old-fashioned way, giving quizzes after watching the video to improve their learning.</p><p><strong>Watch on Individual Screens</strong></p><p>According to my research, most teachers like using a shared screen, and this will be beneficial for starting conversations, group learning exercises, and experience sharing. The students can view and learn something from the video at their homes. The students also have an advantage because they can view the video at their own pace, pause it when they want to go somewhere, or move it forwards and backward to the parts of the footage they need to hear again. This video is a way to help them manage the lesson flow so they can take some notes about it or complete the assignments and activities without missing anything.</p><p>Video has been an effective instructional tool for teachers with a track record of improving students’ learning. Today, we are leading the way toward increased reliance on video in the classroom. Video is being creatively used for learning by both teachers and students. Soon, video usage will likely increase even more. A major contributor to this expansion is the increased accessibility of technology and better internet connectivity.</p><p>More and more research supporting the advantages of blended learning will support video usage.

They prefer to watch videos as opposed to reading text-based review. The demand for good review is high with companies and business looking to get reviews of their product on YouTube through popular reviewer.</p><p>YouTube is the second largest search engine after Google and has a billion users a month. This makes YouTube an attractive platform to post product reviews and build trust with consumers.</p><p>Good product review videos give that last push to your potential customers to buy the product you are endorsing. Lastly feedback from these reviews will help your viewers to either purchase or not.</p><p>Product review video creation thus became profitable career for many, so in this article will guide you to create excellent products review channel.</p><p>When creating a YouTube channel, you need to make sure that you have all the equipment needed to start making the content you have chosen which is the product review video. If you are really determined to create one, you don’t need to buy expensive vlogging equipment right away, you can use what you have now if the video is clear and the audio is good.</p><h2 id="What-are-the-things-needed-to-make-a-quality-video"><a href="#What-are-the-things-needed-to-make-a-quality-video" class="headerlink" title="What are the things needed to make a quality video?"></a>What are the things needed to make a quality video?</h2><p><strong>Camera for video:</strong> If you only have your smart phone, that’s good to go if the video is working</p><p><strong>Good Lighting:</strong> Open window for the natural sunlight to come in, better to make video around 8am to 10am you will get the good sunlight that time. But there is affordable ring light in the online shop that you can purchased. Most content creator use right light for steady light and proper video lighting</p><p><strong>Stand&#x2F;Tripod:</strong> Tripod used if you have digital camera and you can use phone stand for your mobile phone for steady video. There is also affordable stand that you can buy online</p><p><strong>Lapel Microphone:</strong> Use lapel microphone that can be connected even if you are using mobile phone for vlogging. This can make your audio quality good and clear.</p><p><strong>Place&#x2F;Studio:</strong> Find extra space in your room where you can sit to vlog properly. Also look for a good background, one that doesn’t grab the viewers’ attention much better to use plain background.</p><p><strong>Products:</strong> Products that you will make a review, the one that you think you can stand until the end. Like for example you can change the brand of the products but you should stick to that type of product, like if you want to talk about Tech then you will do all reviews about Tech, if it’s about skin care product then all the reviews should also be done about skin care.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=27889512&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/728__90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/things-to-prepare-product-review-video.jpg"                      alt="things to prepare product review video"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4530091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/cit_win/banScrn.jpg"                      border="0"                >CollageIt Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Things-to-consider-to-start-Product-Review-Channel"><a href="#Things-to-consider-to-start-Product-Review-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Things to consider to start Product Review Channel"></a>Things to consider to start Product Review Channel</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/924299/11305" target="_top" id="924299"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-924299"                      border="0" alt="" width="520" height="100"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Create-a-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#Create-a-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Create a YouTube Channel"></a><strong>Create a YouTube Channel</strong></h3><p>Before you do a product review, you need to create a YouTube channel where you can post the product review videos you made.

Of course, it’s important from the starts you really need to invest in the product you want to review, so you can start a video reviewing product on your channel if that’s the content you’ve chosen.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1853659/21526" target="_top" id="1853659"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-1853659"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="750"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1853659/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/decide-product-review-type.jpg"                      alt="decide product review type"                ></p><p>For the Brand to notice your video, buy some of their products that you think useful to you and make a review about it, make sure to make a video review creative to stands out to another reviewer. So that when the Brands see your video they will be amazed by at your work. But just make sure that the product your reviewing is approved to or you don’t have any issue with the products, because remember it’s not just the Brand eyeing to your work but the viewers are also looking for such a review.</p><p>When you have a lot of product review video on you channel, other Brands will approach you to offer you to do a review on their product and sometime they also offer payment. But they only offer the payment when they think it’s worth it or they get some sales. In regard with this I’m talking about your community or Subscribers count, because Brands only offer payment for your video if you have stable or more subscribers’ count. So, if you don’t have many subscribers yet, you need to work hard to increase your viewers and patient is more important in this kind of field.</p><p>I recommend sticking with the same kind of products and specialize so that the viewers will familiar that you are the one doing that kind of review. They know immediately whose channel they should search of they ever need your review.</p><h3 id="Script-about-the-Products"><a href="#Script-about-the-Products" class="headerlink" title="Script about the Products"></a><strong>Script about the Products</strong></h3><p>Here is some basic information on how you make a quality script</p><ol><li>The basic information about the products example the price, size, ingredients and or materials</li><li>Where you got</li><li>What you liked about the products</li><li>What you didn’t like</li><li>Worth to buy or not</li><li>Recommendation or your personal thoughts about the product</li></ol><p>Just like product demo videos, product review videos also need a proper script before recording so that you cover everything that you want to without missing any key aspects of the product that you’re reviewing. Keep the review short and to the point because potential customers have come to your channel to watch the review of the product in the market. Concentrate on the products and explain the features in detail to help users determine if the products suit them. You can add your opinion to humanize the product features. As an Influencer, the main purpose of doing product review is to get people to buy the products you feature. You need to build credibly with customers for them to buy what you recommend. To achieve this, you need to give your genuine review by highlight the pros and cons of the product. This will get you the potential customer or subscriber who will happy to buy the products you are endorsing.</p><h3 id="Good-Editing"><a href="#Good-Editing" class="headerlink" title="Good Editing"></a><strong>Good Editing</strong></h3><p>Editing is important if you want to look good.

Tap on the white button at the left bottom corner of the screen and a high resolution snapshot is automatically saved in the Camera Roll folder beside the recorded video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/still-camera.JPG"                      alt="capture still image"                ></p><p><strong>Supported Slow</strong> - Mo Shooting Modes- Do you know the slow motion recording modes supported by iPhone?</p><p>iPhone 5s only can capture 720p at 120 FPS. iPhone 6&#x2F;6 Plus&#x2F;6s&#x2F;6s Plus, iPhone 7&#x2F;7 Plus can capture 720p at 240 FPS. iPhone 8&#x2F;8 Plus and iPhone X can even capture 1080p HD at 240 FPS.</p><p><strong>Space used by slo-mo video</strong> - It is vital to know that the iPhone 5s onwards iOS devices record slow motion video at 120 frames per second (fps). If you record slow motion video at higher frame rates, it takes lesser space than 120fps video.</p><p>The slo-mo video recorded at 1080p resolution at 120 fps uses approximately 375 MB per minute storage space and slow motion video iPhone resolution of 720p at 240 fps uses approximately 300 MB per minute.</p><p><strong>Is slow motion video from normal video possible</strong> - A higher frame rate than normal is required to record a slow motion video., Playing a slow motion video to normal is possible but the reverse is impossible. You get a jerky video with frames jumping here and there when you try to watch a slow motion video from normal. It appears as a series of still snapshots rather than a constant video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4531356&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8fdd149fcaa7058caccc9c4ad5b0d89a/products/tss-box.JPG"                      border="0"                >The Tube Sites Submitter is a fast and efficient tool for anyone who needs to upload videos quickly, easily and automatically to hundreds of tube sites in mere minutes . </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Normal-Speed-Video-to-Slow-Motion"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Normal-Speed-Video-to-Slow-Motion" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Normal Speed Video to Slow Motion"></a>Part 2: How to Change Normal Speed Video to Slow Motion</h2><p>If you’ve recorded a video on iPhone in normal speed and want to turn it into a slow-motion video, or if you can’t record a slow-motion video with your iPhone, you can use some third-party apps to convert them to slow motion videos.

That’s why many filmmakers, editors, and colorists working on film use Look Up Tables, or LUTs, to store color grades as templates to help speed up the process.</p><p>We’re letting you know that you don’t have to work on the film to use LUTs to help personalize and mark your videos. If you’re wondering how you can get started with color grading to speed up your workflow and create better-looking shots for your business, we’ve got you covered.</p><p><strong>LUTs in Movies</strong></p><p>Various LUT types are employed during post-production for color grading and color correction.</p><p>First, the two LUT formats work differently. <strong>A 1D LUT</strong> (usually. lut format) controls a single parameter, generally gamma. A 1D LUT takes a sort of blanket approach; the adjustment applies to everything in the image without much flexibility. One parameter affects all colors, saturations, and contrast. <strong>A 3D LUT</strong> (usually a. cube format) has three axes that independently adjust Hue, Saturation, Luminance, Gamma, and Contrast and can change as conditions in the image change. As such, a 3D LUT is much more flexible and powerful and is the only way to achieve a truly cinematic color grade with LUT.</p><p>The other two types of LUTs can be either 1D or 3D LUTs, but these days they are most often 3D LUTs. The difference between them is when in the process you use them and for what purpose.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-central-3.jpg"                      alt="luts in movies"                ></p><p>An input or camera LUT used at the beginning of the color correction process adjusts the footage so that the color correction tools work correctly. Color corrected recordings that require an input or camera LUT without one can lead to unexpected and unsatisfactory results.</p><p>Conversely, you typically apply a LUT look after you’ve done color correction and moved on to the color grading phase. Use it to dial in the exact artistic look you want. The Look LUT contains instructions to create a predetermined desired look for your shots, which can be an incredible time saver in the color grading process.</p><p>Always colorize an appearance LUT correctly before applying it, as appearance LUTs assume an underlying natural color. If you don’t, you may not see the results that the LUT is supposed to give you.</p><p>LUTs are specially designed for different recording types – LOG, RAW, Rec.709, Rec.2020, HDR, and more. You can apply any LUT to any footage, but if you apply a LUT designed for a specific type of footage to another type, you can end up with a very different look than what you expected. But then it can also give you a result you like, so you are free to experiment as you wish. LUTs are non-destructive, so you can load and delete them at will.</p><p>Many camera manufacturers, software companies, and independent producers offer downloadable LUTs or LUT packs. They often design these skins for specific purposes, such as color correcting footage captured by their cameras or to mimic signature skins seen in movies and TV shows. These skins can give you exactly the color class you want, or you can use them and keep tweaking and tweaking to get the perfect look.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Free-LUTs-sources"><a href="#Part-3-Free-LUTs-sources" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

The best example to explain this scenario is a Doctor. Only a doctor can diagnose and treat the problem. In the same way, a layperson will have no idea about what video resolution is, but for someone related to the filming world, it is a shame for you if you don’t know about video resolution sizes.</p><p>Are you confused about video resolutions? The article understudy will be very helpful for all its readers. Whether a layman or an expert, every person can learn anything from this guide about video resolutions. Let’s start, shall we?</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is Video Resolution?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Types of Video Resolution List</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to Select the Video Resolution to Shoot Your Video Better??</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Video-Resolution"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Video-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Video Resolution"></a>Part 1. What Is Video Resolution</h2><p>If we speak in basic words, video resolution means the number of pixels displayed in each distinct dimension. The resolution of any video is usually written as a combination of height and width. If you want to know how clear the video is or how realistic it looks, then video resolution is that one element that will answer all your questions. Sounds intriguing, right?</p><p>With video resolution, you can see video images in any video recording. When you hear someone say the high-resolution video, the viewer can see a sharp and clear video. A higher number of pixels results in high quality and better resolution video. Ultra HD and Full HD are the two widely used video resolutions. Don’t know much about them? Nothing to worry!</p><p>Whereas, whenever you come across the word low-resolution video or poor resolution video, it means that there is a low number of pixels. Now moving on, let us talk a little about the two significant types of video resolution. One is the default type, that’s the ‘Spatial Resolution.’ It is measured in pixels with the height and the width. In contrast, the other type is the ‘Temporal Resolution,’ which is the frames rate.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-video-resolution-for-beginners-1.jpg"                      alt="video resolution in-general"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Types-of-Video-Resolution-List"><a href="#Part-2-Types-of-Video-Resolution-List" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Types of Video Resolution List"></a>Part 2. Types of Video Resolution List</h2><p>After discussing video resolution, now it’s time to jump and discuss the list of video resolutions. There are various resolutions. The naming convention of these resolutions is based on how the pixels are running. It could either be a vertical line moving down the display area, or the movement could be across the frame in a horizontal line.</p><p>Want to know more about them? Without further delay, let us start sharing the video resolution list one by one. The order of types will be from low to high and Ultra HD.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-video-resolution-for-beginners-2.jpg"                      alt="types of video resolutions"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.advancedwebranking.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4715051&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/14edc6ebfdae2e23bbed83d67f50e983/products/33_awr%20logo.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="·-Standard-Definition-Resolution-SD"><a href="#·-Standard-Definition-Resolution-SD" class="headerlink" title="· Standard Definition Resolution (SD)"></a>· Standard Definition Resolution (SD)</h3><p>360p and 480p are the most popular standard definition (SD) resolutions. As mentioned earlier, pixels are a combination of height and width, so 360p is 640 x 360 resolution, whereas 640 x 480 is 480p resolution. Since the advancement of television and monitors, no one films in SD resolutions anymore. The world is changing, for sure!</p><p>360p resolution is still the most suitable option for smartphones and other mobile devices. This is because it uses less data. Whereas DVDs are the best example of using 480p resolution size.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1572622/13846" target="_top" id="1572622"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1572622"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1298"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1572622/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="·-High-Definition-Resolution-–-720p"><a href="#·-High-Definition-Resolution-–-720p" class="headerlink" title="· High Definition Resolution – 720p"></a>· High Definition Resolution – 720p</h3><p>The resolution world is divided among High Definition Resolution (HD) and Standard Definition Resolution (SD). 720p is the lowest video resolution and is generally referred to as HD. For smaller web content, 720p is an ideal video resolution. Now are days, most computer screens are already HD.</p><h3 id="·-Full-HD-resolution-–-1080p"><a href="#·-Full-HD-resolution-–-1080p" class="headerlink" title="· Full HD resolution – 1080p"></a>· Full HD resolution – 1080p</h3><p>The next type of video resolution that we will talk about is 1080p. This resolution is often known as Full HD resolution. 1080p resolution is now the standard for the industry to film HD digital videos. Full HD videos mostly have a resolution of 1920 x 1080.</p><p>With the advancement and change in time, many smartphones now have a screen resolution of 1080p. The video quality with 1080p resolution is better and clear. Sounds much better!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1872456/14483" target="_top" id="1872456"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1872456"                      border="0" alt="" width="500" height="375"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1872456/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="·-2K-Resolution"><a href="#·-2K-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="· 2K Resolution"></a>· 2K Resolution</h3><p>The next type of video resolution is 2K video resolution. It is generally known as QHD or Quad High Definition. This type of resolution is found on high-end smartphones and gaming monitors. With every next resolution we are discussing, the video quality is getting better and better. With these resolutions, reframing is done without any quality loss.</p><p>Another thing that you should know about 2K videos is because it has a resolution of 2048 x 1080. A crazy thing about QHD is that some premium smartphones offer Quad HD+. Isn’t it great?</p><h3 id="·-4K-Resolution"><a href="#·-4K-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="· 4K Resolution"></a>· 4K Resolution</h3><p>As we mentioned earlier that the quality is improving with every next type of resolution, so now it’s time to talk about the Ultra High Definition or the 4K video resolution. Although 2K and 4K are somewhat, similar experts say that with 4K, you have better editing options, and you can also zoom in.</p><p>4K resolution is used where you need intense color and graphics. 4K videos have a resolution of 3840 x 2160. This really is something!</p><h3 id="·-8K-Resolution"><a href="#·-8K-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="· 8K Resolution"></a>· 8K Resolution</h3><p>The last video resolution type that we will highlight is 8K video resolution. This is also referred to as Full Ultra High Definition. This is the best option for zooming in to take a distant shot. 8k is the video super-resolution.</p><p>Although filmmakers don’t usually film with this video resolution, if they do, then one thing that they achieve is enhanced visual effects. Also, with using 8K video resolution, you can easily reframe without the fear of losing quality. It has a video resolution of 7680 x 4320.

What Is Video Resolution"></a>Part 1. What Is Video Resolution</h2><p>If we speak in basic words, video resolution means the number of pixels displayed in each distinct dimension. The resolution of any video is usually written as a combination of height and width. If you want to know how clear the video is or how realistic it looks, then video resolution is that one element that will answer all your questions. Sounds intriguing, right?</p><p>With video resolution, you can see video images in any video recording. When you hear someone say the high-resolution video, the viewer can see a sharp and clear video. A higher number of pixels results in high quality and better resolution video. Ultra HD and Full HD are the two widely used video resolutions. Don’t know much about them? Nothing to worry!</p><p>Whereas, whenever you come across the word low-resolution video or poor resolution video, it means that there is a low number of pixels. Now moving on, let us talk a little about the two significant types of video resolution. One is the default type, that’s the ‘Spatial Resolution.’ It is measured in pixels with the height and the width. In contrast, the other type is the ‘Temporal Resolution,’ which is the frames rate.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1853659/21526" target="_top" id="1853659"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-1853659"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="750"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1853659/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-video-resolution-for-beginners-1.jpg"                      alt="video resolution in-general"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Types-of-Video-Resolution-List-1"><a href="#Part-2-Types-of-Video-Resolution-List-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

What Is Video Resolution"></a>Part 1. What Is Video Resolution</h2><p>If we speak in basic words, video resolution means the number of pixels displayed in each distinct dimension. The resolution of any video is usually written as a combination of height and width. If you want to know how clear the video is or how realistic it looks, then video resolution is that one element that will answer all your questions. Sounds intriguing, right?</p><p>With video resolution, you can see video images in any video recording. When you hear someone say the high-resolution video, the viewer can see a sharp and clear video. A higher number of pixels results in high quality and better resolution video. Ultra HD and Full HD are the two widely used video resolutions. Don’t know much about them? Nothing to worry!</p><p>Whereas, whenever you come across the word low-resolution video or poor resolution video, it means that there is a low number of pixels. Now moving on, let us talk a little about the two significant types of video resolution. One is the default type, that’s the ‘Spatial Resolution.’ It is measured in pixels with the height and the width. In contrast, the other type is the ‘Temporal Resolution,’ which is the frames rate.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4709458&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://3d-kstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Project-Manager-3D-Models-4-800x800.jpg"                      border="0"                >Project Manager - Asset Browser for 3Ds Max</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-video-resolution-for-beginners-1.jpg"                      alt="video resolution in-general"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Types-of-Video-Resolution-List-3"><a href="#Part-2-Types-of-Video-Resolution-List-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Since the advancement of television and monitors, no one films in SD resolutions anymore.

Back in the days defining the internet was practically impossible, but people had an idea of what it would bring. However, Metaverse goes hand in hand with the avatar Metaverse.</p><p>As the name Meta suggests, Metaverse refers to a digital reality whose main objective is to blend in virtual reality, augmented reality, social media platforms, cryptocurrencies, and online gaming. Of course, we currently have platforms that feature avatars and virtual identities, but they include one flaw: all these features work on the same platform. This individuality syndrome is what Metaverse wishes to solve.</p><p>In our case, we are discussing the <strong>Metaverse Avatar</strong> and the most straightforward way to create one.

When Metaverse Avatar comes about, think of an icon representing you in the VR (Virtual Reality). Therefore, as technical experts talk of Metaverse, an avatar is equally essential. Why? Because it is what you use to identify yourself in the digital world.</p><p>Think of it in the sense of how you go about opening a social media account. Typically, you will upload your photo as a visual representation of yourself on the platform. The same case happens when dealing with Metaverse; you need an avatar.

For a listener to give the episode a second look, they first need to know that it’s something they should listen to. Therefore, it would be best to make a compelling description to convince someone to listen to your show.</p><p>Some basic rules of thumb for writing a good description:</p><ul><li>Include a clear subject line.</li><li>Introduce your topic.</li><li>Explain how the episode relates to the rest of your show.</li></ul><h3 id="Bold-cover-art-1"><a href="#Bold-cover-art-1" class="headerlink" title="Bold cover art"></a>Bold cover art</h3><p>A simple way to add personality to your podcast is by using bold cover art. It shows that you care about the quality of your audio content, and the image communicates your message. The cover art should be proactive and distinctive but subtle enough not to distract from the show itself.</p><p>Remember that most people use mobile devices to browse podcasts. That means your cover art must be easily readable on small screens.

What is new about the past couple of years’ experience regarding buzzwords in their profusion? That is thanks to the COVID 19 pandemic which rather contrary to common-sense expectations acted as a catalyst to processes that were either yet to be hatched or were lying dormant. The world of tech has been at the forefront of such unfolding and hence words like Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Cloud, Hyper Automation, Metaverse, Everything as a service (XaaS), Quantum Computing, Cybersecurity Mesh, and many, many more have gained wide currency rather quickly. So let us begin at the beginning by understanding what it is that we talk about when we are talking about Metaverse nowadays.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.abbyy.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39254762&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/0e5fb5c76fca16adbee503c9aff393cd/products/11_FR-Badges-NEW-FR-Standard-16-WIN-200.png"                      border="0"                > PDF application, powered by AI-based OCR, for unified workflows with both digital and scanned documents. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Device"                ></p><p>Source: thenextweb.com</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is Metaverse Technology?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Eye on the Future: Where Will Metaverse Go?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Metaverse-Technology"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Metaverse-Technology" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Metaverse Technology?"></a>Part 1: What Is Metaverse Technology?</h2><p>The word Metaverse might be a hot topic today but it has been around for quite a significant amount of time now. In his 1992 sci-fi novel “Snow Crash”, author Neal Stephenson coined the term first. The word referred to the author’s projection of a world that is a 3D simulation per excellence populated by lifelike virtual avatars. The world has moved on since 1992 and so the idea of Metaverse has undergone further developments as well. Tech milestones like augmented reality, virtual reality, 3D holographic avatars, and advanced communication techniques, all forayed into the arena.</p><p>So yes, Metaverse is quite literally a digital universe that is given body by the joint efforts made by the above-noted technologies. Here users, or more precisely, their digital avatars, can live in the truest sense of the word. As of now, using an assortment of metaverse devices, users can work, play, socialize in this virtual realm. They can even visit concerts, join conferences or take virtual trips around the Metaverse using this technology. If you want to know more details about Metaverse, this article will be helpful: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Everything you wanted to know about the metaverse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>To get a fairer idea, one can head straight to a number of social media platforms and game universes that are offering today entry into such hyper-real virtual spaces. Some of these platforms are:</p><h3 id="1-Meta"><a href="#1-Meta" class="headerlink" title="1. Meta"></a>1. Meta</h3><p>Apart from the acquisition of Oculus, a company that manufactures Virtual Reality (VR) headsets, in 2014, the tech mammoth Facebook has made public its immense interest in virtual reality by rebranding itself as Meta this year. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, voiced his support for the Metaverse when, while declaring the rebranding, he said, “The next platform and medium will be a much more immersive and embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it, and we call this the metaverse.” Meta has delivered on this by unveiling the Horizon Workrooms beta, a virtual meeting area designed for co-workers to hold their meetings using a metaverse device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device-meta.jpg"                      alt="metaverse device meta"                ></p><h3 id="2-Microsoft"><a href="#2-Microsoft" class="headerlink" title="2. Microsoft"></a>2. Microsoft</h3><p>It is another tech giant that has advanced considerably in this direction when it revealed its very own hologram technology back in 2019. Microsoft holograms can change someone into a digital speaker of an alien language. The Microsoft Mesh platform has since then been busy developing mixed and extended reality applications. Microsoft has also made known its intention of developing Microsoft Teams along these lines in 2022. Collaboration with the U.S. army is also underway aimed at designing an augmented reality Hololens 2 hardware that will help soldiers train better. Microsoft’s Xbox Live must be accounted for here as well as it establishes connections between millions of video gamers from around the globe. The company would also start working on the development of 3D hyper-real spaces for the world of retail and general workplaces.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1300375&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-15_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Epic-Games"><a href="#3-Epic-Games" class="headerlink" title="3. Epic Games"></a>3. Epic Games</h3><p>Epic Games is a video game company that has made headlines by virtue of its extraordinary contributions in this regard. “It’s no secret that Epic is invested in building the metaverse”, said Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games. Epic Games has made it further immersive by holding music concerts by artists like Arianna Grande, Travis Scott, unveiling movie trailers and music debuts in the metaverse. A splendid remaking of Martin Luther King Jr’s famed “I Have a Dream” speech earned it further credentials. Epic Games is reportedly emphasizing its MetaHuman Creator, a technology that helps users customize better their digital avatars.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aspironcom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1941789/21554" target="_top" id="1941789"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21554-1941789"                      border="0" alt="" width="650" height="800"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1941789/21554"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Must-Have-Metaverse-Devices-You-Should-Know"><a href="#Part-2-Must-Have-Metaverse-Devices-You-Should-Know" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know"></a>Part 2: Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know</h2><p>It is entering the metaverse that necessitates that one first has one’s props ready. Below are discussed metaverse devices that are crucial for such transportation.</p><h3 id="1-Computer-PC"><a href="#1-Computer-PC" class="headerlink" title="1. Computer (PC)"></a>1. Computer (PC)</h3><p>Laying your hands on a perfectly functioning computer device is one of the first necessities. Intel grabbed worldwide attention a few days ago when it said that for metaverse to work properly, one will need devices with 1000x more computing power than what the technology offers today. But since metaverse is still in its embryo, the configuration we have already functioned just fine.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082526/7443" target="_top" id="2082526"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082526"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082526/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Smartphone"><a href="#2-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="2.

As long as the ethical underpinnings of such a development get predominant over the technology part, we must welcome such efforts. As some reports on the prevailing sexist atmospheres in some metaverse spaces have underlined, the realm needs regulations. The impact on the environment, data privacy are some other issues that we must come to terms with. Beyond these, the possibilities that metaverse technology has already pointed at herald a future that is every bit worth experiencing.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>The concept of metaverse needs not be demonized at this early stage. In fact, the very fact that the idea is still inchoate makes us agents of deciding whether we want to create a bubble universe that keeps out the digital proletariat or a universe that can get past the constraints of time and space to give a new lease of human creativity. But whatever the path that the technology takes, it is beyond dispute that the metaverse is here to stay. And this makes it mandatory that one gets acquainted with the gears that are needed to undertake this journey. With a flurry of brands offering good products, the only thing one needs to get right is the basics of such devices.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Buzzwords are nothing new. What is new about the past couple of years’ experience regarding buzzwords in their profusion? That is thanks to the COVID 19 pandemic which rather contrary to common-sense expectations acted as a catalyst to processes that were either yet to be hatched or were lying dormant. The world of tech has been at the forefront of such unfolding and hence words like Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Cloud, Hyper Automation, Metaverse, Everything as a service (XaaS), Quantum Computing, Cybersecurity Mesh, and many, many more have gained wide currency rather quickly. So let us begin at the beginning by understanding what it is that we talk about when we are talking about Metaverse nowadays.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Device"                ></p><p>Source: thenextweb.com</p><h4 id="In-this-article-1"><a href="#In-this-article-1" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is Metaverse Technology?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Eye on the Future: Where Will Metaverse Go?</a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698832&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/karaoki-new-searchresultspane.jpg"                      border="0"                >PCDJ Karaoki is the complete professional karaoke software designed for KJs and karaoke venues.

In his 1992 sci-fi novel “Snow Crash”, author Neal Stephenson coined the term first. The word referred to the author’s projection of a world that is a 3D simulation per excellence populated by lifelike virtual avatars. The world has moved on since 1992 and so the idea of Metaverse has undergone further developments as well. Tech milestones like augmented reality, virtual reality, 3D holographic avatars, and advanced communication techniques, all forayed into the arena.</p><p>So yes, Metaverse is quite literally a digital universe that is given body by the joint efforts made by the above-noted technologies. Here users, or more precisely, their digital avatars, can live in the truest sense of the word. As of now, using an assortment of metaverse devices, users can work, play, socialize in this virtual realm. They can even visit concerts, join conferences or take virtual trips around the Metaverse using this technology.

Some of these platforms are:</p><h3 id="1-Meta-1"><a href="#1-Meta-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Meta"></a>1. Meta</h3><p>Apart from the acquisition of Oculus, a company that manufactures Virtual Reality (VR) headsets, in 2014, the tech mammoth Facebook has made public its immense interest in virtual reality by rebranding itself as Meta this year. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, voiced his support for the Metaverse when, while declaring the rebranding, he said, “The next platform and medium will be a much more immersive and embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it, and we call this the metaverse.” Meta has delivered on this by unveiling the Horizon Workrooms beta, a virtual meeting area designed for co-workers to hold their meetings using a metaverse device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=194977&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.blumentals.net/scrfactory/images/screensaver-software.png"                      border="0"                >Screensaver Factory, Create stunning professional screensavers within minutes.

Microsoft holograms can change someone into a digital speaker of an alien language. The Microsoft Mesh platform has since then been busy developing mixed and extended reality applications. Microsoft has also made known its intention of developing Microsoft Teams along these lines in 2022. Collaboration with the U.S. army is also underway aimed at designing an augmented reality Hololens 2 hardware that will help soldiers train better. Microsoft’s Xbox Live must be accounted for here as well as it establishes connections between millions of video gamers from around the globe.

Epic Games has made it further immersive by holding music concerts by artists like Arianna Grande, Travis Scott, unveiling movie trailers and music debuts in the metaverse. A splendid remaking of Martin Luther King Jr’s famed “I Have a Dream” speech earned it further credentials.

As long as the ethical underpinnings of such a development get predominant over the technology part, we must welcome such efforts. As some reports on the prevailing sexist atmospheres in some metaverse spaces have underlined, the realm needs regulations. The impact on the environment, data privacy are some other issues that we must come to terms with. Beyond these, the possibilities that metaverse technology has already pointed at herald a future that is every bit worth experiencing.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>The concept of metaverse needs not be demonized at this early stage. In fact, the very fact that the idea is still inchoate makes us agents of deciding whether we want to create a bubble universe that keeps out the digital proletariat or a universe that can get past the constraints of time and space to give a new lease of human creativity. But whatever the path that the technology takes, it is beyond dispute that the metaverse is here to stay. And this makes it mandatory that one gets acquainted with the gears that are needed to undertake this journey. With a flurry of brands offering good products, the only thing one needs to get right is the basics of such devices.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Buzzwords are nothing new. What is new about the past couple of years’ experience regarding buzzwords in their profusion? That is thanks to the COVID 19 pandemic which rather contrary to common-sense expectations acted as a catalyst to processes that were either yet to be hatched or were lying dormant. The world of tech has been at the forefront of such unfolding and hence words like Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Cloud, Hyper Automation, Metaverse, Everything as a service (XaaS), Quantum Computing, Cybersecurity Mesh, and many, many more have gained wide currency rather quickly. So let us begin at the beginning by understanding what it is that we talk about when we are talking about Metaverse nowadays.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087264/19272" target="_top" id="2087264"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087264"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087264/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Device"                ></p><p>Source: thenextweb.com</p><h4 id="In-this-article-2"><a href="#In-this-article-2" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is Metaverse Technology?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Eye on the Future: Where Will Metaverse Go?</a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeachus.sjv.io/c/5597632/1988416/23719" target="_top" id="1988416"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23719-1988416"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1988416/23719"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Metaverse-Technology-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Metaverse-Technology-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Metaverse Technology?"></a>Part 1: What Is Metaverse Technology?</h2><p>The word Metaverse might be a hot topic today but it has been around for quite a significant amount of time now. In his 1992 sci-fi novel “Snow Crash”, author Neal Stephenson coined the term first. The word referred to the author’s projection of a world that is a 3D simulation per excellence populated by lifelike virtual avatars. The world has moved on since 1992 and so the idea of Metaverse has undergone further developments as well. Tech milestones like augmented reality, virtual reality, 3D holographic avatars, and advanced communication techniques, all forayed into the arena.</p><p>So yes, Metaverse is quite literally a digital universe that is given body by the joint efforts made by the above-noted technologies. Here users, or more precisely, their digital avatars, can live in the truest sense of the word. As of now, using an assortment of metaverse devices, users can work, play, socialize in this virtual realm. They can even visit concerts, join conferences or take virtual trips around the Metaverse using this technology.

What is new about the past couple of years’ experience regarding buzzwords in their profusion? That is thanks to the COVID 19 pandemic which rather contrary to common-sense expectations acted as a catalyst to processes that were either yet to be hatched or were lying dormant. The world of tech has been at the forefront of such unfolding and hence words like Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Cloud, Hyper Automation, Metaverse, Everything as a service (XaaS), Quantum Computing, Cybersecurity Mesh, and many, many more have gained wide currency rather quickly. So let us begin at the beginning by understanding what it is that we talk about when we are talking about Metaverse nowadays.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Device"                ></p><p>Source: thenextweb.com</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is Metaverse Technology?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Eye on the Future: Where Will Metaverse Go?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Metaverse-Technology-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Metaverse-Technology-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Metaverse Technology?"></a>Part 1: What Is Metaverse Technology?</h2><p>The word Metaverse might be a hot topic today but it has been around for quite a significant amount of time now. In his 1992 sci-fi novel “Snow Crash”, author Neal Stephenson coined the term first. The word referred to the author’s projection of a world that is a 3D simulation per excellence populated by lifelike virtual avatars. The world has moved on since 1992 and so the idea of Metaverse has undergone further developments as well. Tech milestones like augmented reality, virtual reality, 3D holographic avatars, and advanced communication techniques, all forayed into the arena.</p><p>So yes, Metaverse is quite literally a digital universe that is given body by the joint efforts made by the above-noted technologies. Here users, or more precisely, their digital avatars, can live in the truest sense of the word. As of now, using an assortment of metaverse devices, users can work, play, socialize in this virtual realm. They can even visit concerts, join conferences or take virtual trips around the Metaverse using this technology.

Some of these platforms are:</p><h3 id="1-Meta-3"><a href="#1-Meta-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Meta"></a>1. Meta</h3><p>Apart from the acquisition of Oculus, a company that manufactures Virtual Reality (VR) headsets, in 2014, the tech mammoth Facebook has made public its immense interest in virtual reality by rebranding itself as Meta this year. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, voiced his support for the Metaverse when, while declaring the rebranding, he said, “The next platform and medium will be a much more immersive and embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it, and we call this the metaverse.” Meta has delivered on this by unveiling the Horizon Workrooms beta, a virtual meeting area designed for co-workers to hold their meetings using a metaverse device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device-meta.jpg"                      alt="metaverse device meta"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958379/18409" target="_top" id="1958379"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958379"                      border="0" alt="" width="856" height="508"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1958379/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Microsoft-3"><a href="#2-Microsoft-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

Microsoft holograms can change someone into a digital speaker of an alien language. The Microsoft Mesh platform has since then been busy developing mixed and extended reality applications. Microsoft has also made known its intention of developing Microsoft Teams along these lines in 2022. Collaboration with the U.S. army is also underway aimed at designing an augmented reality Hololens 2 hardware that will help soldiers train better. Microsoft’s Xbox Live must be accounted for here as well as it establishes connections between millions of video gamers from around the globe. The company would also start working on the development of 3D hyper-real spaces for the world of retail and general workplaces.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40002580&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/3_Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF 2-Year Plan</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Epic-Games-3"><a href="#3-Epic-Games-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

Epic Games has made it further immersive by holding music concerts by artists like Arianna Grande, Travis Scott, unveiling movie trailers and music debuts in the metaverse. A splendid remaking of Martin Luther King Jr’s famed “I Have a Dream” speech earned it further credentials. Epic Games is reportedly emphasizing its MetaHuman Creator, a technology that helps users customize better their digital avatars.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Must-Have-Metaverse-Devices-You-Should-Know-3"><a href="#Part-2-Must-Have-Metaverse-Devices-You-Should-Know-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know"></a>Part 2: Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know</h2><p>It is entering the metaverse that necessitates that one first has one’s props ready.

However, not many people know what the term means. In addition, identifying sources for public domain art can be challenging if you are unaware of what these creative works entail.</p><p>Here is a full overview of public domain art, including how to find royalty-free art for your creations. Furthermore, you will find answers to the most frequently asked questions concerning royalty-free art.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">what are public domain arts</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">What is the copyright policy of famous art in history</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Can you use them for free</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Public Domain Pictures</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-2">Wikimedia Commons</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-3">The New York Public Library Digital Collections</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-4">Flickr Commons</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Best Public Domain Art Search Engine</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">Artvee.com</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-2">Museo</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">FAQ</a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1300375&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-15_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part1-What-is-Public-Domain-Artwork"><a href="#Part1-What-is-Public-Domain-Artwork" class="headerlink" title="Part1: What is Public Domain Artwork?"></a>Part1: What is Public Domain Artwork?</h2><p>Did you know that not all items you find on the internet are public domain? For example, regardless of the source, you cannot use someone’s street art in your commercial campaigns without their consent. In addition, different artists offer their work under various licenses, each with its unique usage requirements. For example, artwork under the Creative Commons license is free to use for personal and commercial purposes.</p><p>However, not all platforms offer the license information freely. Therefore, here is some information to help you identify royalty-free art you can use for your creative projects.</p><h3 id="So-what-are-public-domain-arts"><a href="#So-what-are-public-domain-arts" class="headerlink" title="So, what are public domain arts?"></a>So, what are public domain arts?</h3><p>Public domain arts are any creation out of copyright, meaning you can use it hassle-free. In addition, public domain arts span various creations, including graffiti, video mash-ups, songs, images, and paintings. Furthermore, most government copyright offices do not list public domain arts on their websites.</p><p>However, the following are the determining factors for work to become public domain.</p><p><strong>The copyright protection is expired</strong></p><p>Any work between 50 and 70 years old after the author’s death is public domain art. However, the copyright expiry can vary between countries. Therefore, familiarize yourself with your country’s copyright policy before using such works.</p><p><strong>The art does not meet the requirements for copyright protection</strong></p><p>In many countries, recipes, facts, and calendar dates do not qualify for copyright protection. However, you can face legal action if they include original descriptions and artwork. For example, reposting the images from last year’s calendar is a violation if a professional photographer does them.</p><p>In addition, some countries do not consider government documents as copyright items. For example, planet photos and videos from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are <a class="link"   href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/index.html" >public domain art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, meaning you can use them freely for commercial and personal creations.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://lightailing.sjv.io/c/5597632/1725213/17190" target="_top" id="1725213"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17190-1725213"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1725213/17190"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="What-is-the-copyright-policy-of-famous-art-in-history"><a href="#What-is-the-copyright-policy-of-famous-art-in-history" class="headerlink" title="What is the copyright policy of famous art in history?"></a>What is the copyright policy of famous art in history?</h3><p>As mentioned above, you cannot rely on copyright websites to determine if your desired art is royalty-free, especially when the artist’s work is unpublished. However, the following tips can be useful in helping you avoid copyright violations. Kindly note that the tips below are for your general knowledge, and you should not rely on them as legal expert advice.</p><ol><li>All work published before January 1st, 1923 is public domain art. However, famous art between 75 and 100 years old may have copyright extensions, which can affect their usage in other projects. Therefore, you should check with the current owner to determine whether they are royalty-free art.</li><li>You can freely use your photo of famous paintings, drawings, and sculptures if they are an exact reproduction of the public domain artwork. This is because you automatically earn the copyright since the photo includes elements of your originality, such as the camera angle and post-production techniques.</li><li>You can not use a third-party photo of public domain art if the resulting image is a derivative. This is because the law recognizes the creator as the author and copyright owner. As such, you must have verifiable permission before using their work in your creations.</li><li>Not all items without a © are in the public domain. This is because modern video editing software allows you to remove copyright symbols from different works. Therefore, always perform a reverse image search when unsure of the photo’s origins.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4709458&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://3d-kstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Project-Manager-version-3-1600x900-768x419.jpg"                      border="0"                >Project Manager - Asset Browser for 3Ds Max</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Can-you-use-them-for-free"><a href="#Can-you-use-them-for-free" class="headerlink" title="Can you use them for free?"></a>Can you use them for free?</h3><p>Yes. You can use royalty-free art for whatever purpose you see fit. For example, you can reproduce the text and illustrations from the original version of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) because they are in the public domain.</p><p>However, the reproduction of the 1951 version by Walt Disney is a copyright violation since it is a derivative of the original version. In addition, The Walt Disney Company owns the trademark for all the derivatives, including the movie, cartoon characters, and merchandise.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4535075&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/GU-500_672.png"                      border="0"                >Glary Utilities PRO -  Premium all-in-one utility to clean, speed up, maintain and protect your PC</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part2-Best-Official-Public-Domain-Art-websites-recommendations"><a href="#Part2-Best-Official-Public-Domain-Art-websites-recommendations" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations"></a>Part2: Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations</h2><p>Now that you know what constitutes being in the public domain, where can you find public domain creative assets?

In addition, you can easily identify your desired pictures using the categories tab. However, you need to purchase the Premium Download option if you want them in larger resolutions. Furthermore, some royalty-free art may include usage restrictions, which are clearly stated in the image description. For example, you cannot use photos with paid models for offensive campaigns.</p><h3 id="2-Wikimedia-Commons"><a href="#2-Wikimedia-Commons" class="headerlink" title="2. Wikimedia Commons"></a>2.

It hosts over 86 million creative assets from global contributors. In addition, the interface is available in multiple languages, making it accessible to everyone. However, some consider it challenging to use, given the large database. However, the developers offer you recommendations through designated tabs like Valued Images and Featured Pictures. Although most of the content is free to use, you will find images that require you to acknowledge the contributor before using them.</p><h3 id="3-The-New-York-Public-Library-Digital-Collections"><a href="#3-The-New-York-Public-Library-Digital-Collections" class="headerlink" title="3.

In addition, public domain arts span various creations, including graffiti, video mash-ups, songs, images, and paintings. Furthermore, most government copyright offices do not list public domain arts on their websites.</p><p>However, the following are the determining factors for work to become public domain.</p><p><strong>The copyright protection is expired</strong></p><p>Any work between 50 and 70 years old after the author’s death is public domain art. However, the copyright expiry can vary between countries. Therefore, familiarize yourself with your country’s copyright policy before using such works.</p><p><strong>The art does not meet the requirements for copyright protection</strong></p><p>In many countries, recipes, facts, and calendar dates do not qualify for copyright protection. However, you can face legal action if they include original descriptions and artwork. For example, reposting the images from last year’s calendar is a violation if a professional photographer does them.</p><p>In addition, some countries do not consider government documents as copyright items. For example, planet photos and videos from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are <a class="link"   href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/index.html" >public domain art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, meaning you can use them freely for commercial and personal creations.</p><h3 id="What-is-the-copyright-policy-of-famous-art-in-history-1"><a href="#What-is-the-copyright-policy-of-famous-art-in-history-1" class="headerlink" title="What is the copyright policy of famous art in history?"></a>What is the copyright policy of famous art in history?</h3><p>As mentioned above, you cannot rely on copyright websites to determine if your desired art is royalty-free, especially when the artist’s work is unpublished. However, the following tips can be useful in helping you avoid copyright violations. Kindly note that the tips below are for your general knowledge, and you should not rely on them as legal expert advice.</p><ol><li>All work published before January 1st, 1923 is public domain art. However, famous art between 75 and 100 years old may have copyright extensions, which can affect their usage in other projects. Therefore, you should check with the current owner to determine whether they are royalty-free art.</li><li>You can freely use your photo of famous paintings, drawings, and sculptures if they are an exact reproduction of the public domain artwork. This is because you automatically earn the copyright since the photo includes elements of your originality, such as the camera angle and post-production techniques.</li><li>You can not use a third-party photo of public domain art if the resulting image is a derivative. This is because the law recognizes the creator as the author and copyright owner. As such, you must have verifiable permission before using their work in your creations.</li><li>Not all items without a © are in the public domain. This is because modern video editing software allows you to remove copyright symbols from different works. Therefore, always perform a reverse image search when unsure of the photo’s origins.</li></ol><h3 id="Can-you-use-them-for-free-1"><a href="#Can-you-use-them-for-free-1" class="headerlink" title="Can you use them for free?"></a>Can you use them for free?</h3><p>Yes. You can use royalty-free art for whatever purpose you see fit. For example, you can reproduce the text and illustrations from the original version of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) because they are in the public domain.</p><p>However, the reproduction of the 1951 version by Walt Disney is a copyright violation since it is a derivative of the original version. In addition, The Walt Disney Company owns the trademark for all the derivatives, including the movie, cartoon characters, and merchandise.</p><h2 id="Part2-Best-Official-Public-Domain-Art-websites-recommendations-1"><a href="#Part2-Best-Official-Public-Domain-Art-websites-recommendations-1" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations"></a>Part2: Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations</h2><p>Now that you know what constitutes being in the public domain, where can you find public domain creative assets?

However, through their partnership with the Library of Congress in 2008, you can now access thousands of public domain historical photos from institutions like UC Berkeley and the Armenian Studies Program - Fresno State.</p><p>In addition, most of the photos on the Flickr Commons library are listed with <strong>no known copyright restrictions</strong>. Therefore, you can download and use them without fear of any repercussions. Furthermore, the search engine includes multiple filters for more accurate results. For example, you can filter photos by color, orientation, and date. Alternatively, you can find public domain content by visiting the Public Domain group URL.</p><h2 id="Part3-Best-Public-Domain-Art-Search-Engine-1"><a href="#Part3-Best-Public-Domain-Art-Search-Engine-1" class="headerlink" title="Part3: Best Public Domain Art Search Engine"></a>Part3: Best Public Domain Art Search Engine</h2><p>Although Google search is the most popular resource for royalty-free art, there are specific public domain art search engines to help you find exactly what you need.

The platform allows you to search millions of public domain images from some of the world’s top museums, including the Smithsonian and the Met.</p><p>In addition, Artvee.com offers you keyword suggestions depending on user popularity. Alternatively, you can use the Artists tab to locate classical art by specific painters, including Claude Monet and Vincent Van Gogh. Furthermore, you do not need to register an account to use the service. You only need to enter the URL in your browser, narrow down the results using keywords and click download.</p><h3 id="2-Museo-1"><a href="#2-Museo-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

Royalty-free art refers to work that has no recurring payments to the author. However, it may contain usage restrictions depending on the source website. For example, you may need to make a one-time payment to download the image.</p><p>Conversely, public domain art is copyright free and does not require you to make any payments to use it.

Many podcasters only focus on the podcast’s content, which they should, but ignore the visual identity of the podcast.</p><p>In this guide, we will guide you to design a stunning and unique podcast cover. But before that, we will acquaint you with all the necessary elements of an eye-catching podcast cover image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast cover image"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1095219&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-20_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Round-Up-10-Tips-to-Design-Podcast-Cover-Art"><a href="#Round-Up-10-Tips-to-Design-Podcast-Cover-Art" class="headerlink" title="Round-Up 10 Tips to Design Podcast Cover Art"></a>Round-Up 10 Tips to Design Podcast Cover Art</h2><p>These are not tips but 101 guides on podcast cover-making. All the ten key points mentioned here will enable you to create a podcast cover image that stands out and catch the user’s attention.</p><h3 id="1-Make-sure-the-podcast-cover-meets-podcast-platform-requirements"><a href="#1-Make-sure-the-podcast-cover-meets-podcast-platform-requirements" class="headerlink" title="1. Make sure the podcast cover meets podcast platform requirements"></a>1. Make sure the podcast cover meets podcast platform requirements</h3><p>To make your podcast accessible to people worldwide, you have to publish them to podcast platforms, otherwise known as podcast directories. For instance, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Podcasts are podcast directories.</p><p>The good thing is most podcast directories have a similar requirement for the podcast cover art dimensions, resolution, and file type. Still, some podcast directories have special needs. So, ensure to know the requirement of each podcast directory that you plan to publish your podcasts on and select the canvas accordingly.</p><p>For instance, the podcast cover size demanded by Apple Podcast is:</p><ul><li>3000 x 3000 pixels</li><li>Resolution of 72 dpi</li><li>JPG or PNG file type</li><li>RGB color-space</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-2.jpg"                      alt="apple podcast cover image"                ></p><p>Google Podcasts, a popular podcast platform among Android users, also has the same or similar requirements for the podcast cover image. That is to say, you do not have to design a podcast cover exclusive to Google Podcasts.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are some platforms that have different requirements. For instance, Spotify mentions the following need for a podcast cover image:</p><ul><li>TIFF, PNG, or JPG format using loss-less encoding</li><li>The highest resolution available</li><li>At least 640px wide and tall</li><li>1:1 aspect ratio</li><li>Encoded with an sRGB color space, 24bits per pixel, with color profiles applied directly.</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: The thing to remember is to design podcast covers for all platforms with different requirements. It may seem daunting, but limitations and provisions often unleash a person’s creativity. Needless to say, if you are a professional podcaster and your teammates responsible for podcast cover making, then you can leave it to them.</p><h3 id="2-Straight-to-the-point"><a href="#2-Straight-to-the-point" class="headerlink" title="2. Straight to the point"></a>2. Straight to the point</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-3.jpg"                      alt="podcast straight to the point image"                ></p><p>People often confuse “straight to the point” with plain and simple. However, it is an unjust explanation of what is straight to the point. Additionally, achieving the “straight to the point” scale is not simple.</p><p>Put, “straight to the point” means something that best projects your podcast theme with a user who has never even engaged with your podcast. For instance, if your podcast discusses movies, then do not simply design a podcast cover with the blockbuster sign.</p><p>Instead, brainstorm ideas for what you often differ in the podcast, like a specific genre or movie series. Once you narrow down the ideas, you can design a podcast cover that is straight to the point, i.e., it conveys the message creatively.</p><p>Here are some examples to help you think in the “straight to the point” fashion:</p><p><strong>Example #1 ― Entrepreneurs like it simple, plain, and sophisticated.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-4.jpg"                      alt="podcast straight to the point image"                ></p><p>The above podcast cover designs are related to business.

Here are some of the most prominent trends in the podcast world today and their significance:</p><p><strong>Example # 1. Red background with light text</strong></p><p>If you are into sales, you might already be familiar with the concept of red. Basically, red is the color of love, excitement, and anger.

You can find such podcast covers on topics ranging from history to anthropology, psychology to music, and so on.</p><p><strong>Example #2. Blue background with light text</strong></p><p>Blue is the color of trust, competency, and quality.
