Personalize the Start Menu"></a>1. Personalize the Start Menu</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/a8.png"                      alt="a8"                ></p><p>The start menu of Windows 10 is now resizable. It can be quote odd for many but it is really surprising to know that with Windows 10, you can now customize the start menu and change its size to the extent you want. You now have the option to make it taller or wider as you like. If you wish to have the start menu taking up the whole left portion of the screen of your laptop or you want a thin strip transversely the taskbar, well that is now possible with Windows 10. The taskbar is also resizable and that means you have the ability to some weird and pretty cool stuff with your device. You will surely find that having a resizable Start Menu is cool.</p><h4 id="2-Using-Cortana-in-Windows-10"><a href="#2-Using-Cortana-in-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="2. Using Cortana in Windows 10"></a>2. Using Cortana in Windows 10</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/update-win10-13.png"                      alt="update win10 13"                ></p><p>Cortana is finally here in Windows 10, taking control of the search functions as well as dishing out as much sass of the operating system in the same way with Windows Phone edition. On the other hand, by default, it will never listen and follow your commands.</p><p>If you would like to have the ability to simply bark commands at your personal computer, you launch Cortana through hitting the search field within the taskbar and then choose the Notebook icon in the left side choices pane. You choose “settings” from the list and have the “Let Cortana respond when you say ‘Hey Cortana’” choice. You will have an active and working microphone for it to work.</p><p>While you are poking around the Cortana’s options, you may dive in the Notebook menu so you can fine-tune exactly what data the digital assistant of Microsoft can open. On the other hand, you should bear in mind that like Google, the effectiveness of Cortana is related directly to how much it knows regarding you.</p><h4 id="3-Additional-Apps-you-should-try"><a href="#3-Additional-Apps-you-should-try" class="headerlink" title="3.

Popular platforms linked to the OBS Streamlabs Mac are Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, Mixer, and any other desirable streaming option. The possibilities are limitless. Surely, with this new development, OBS Streamlabs Mac can match close competitors such as the original OBS, ECamm live, and Twitch Studios.</p><p>Subsequently, we will go through the workings of the OBS Streamlabs Mac from download and onwards but, first, it is important to know all about this brilliant Open Broadcast Software and what makes it endearing.</p><h2 id="Streamlabs-OBS-vs-OBS"><a href="#Streamlabs-OBS-vs-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Streamlabs OBS vs OBS"></a>Streamlabs OBS vs OBS</h2><p>The generic OBS is a software put out to the general public to enable streaming in its simplest and unmodified form. For an individual that just wants to stream videos without colorfulness, effects, and additional features, the OBS is perfect.</p><p>However, Streamlabs OBS is improved. Known as SLOBS to its increasing subscribers, Streamlabs OBS enhances user experience and provides a collection of tools to do so in one hub, with no outsourcing.</p><ul><li>OBS (Open Broadcaster Studio)</li></ul><p>It is free and open-source, the code is ‘naked’ to the public. At will, developers can improve on the software. Manual connection to Twitch, YouTube, and the likes is also possible. A few settings here and there and you are set!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/obs-studio.jpg"                      alt="obs studio"                ></p><p>OBS gives a wonderful experience to users albeit with its inefficiencies in providing added features and functions. It is seamless as far as primary recording and broadcasting are concerned, leaving out the extras.</p><p>There are overlays and background designs available on OBS for a price although limited. Largely, users will need to consult other websites—copy and paste—to have varied layout options. It is not much work, however; there are many such websites.</p><ul><li>Streamlabs OBS</li></ul><p>This is an example of when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. Streamlabs saw an opportunity with the original OBS and like any other developer, modified it. They have forged on everyone till this OBS Streamlab Mac version. The code was revamped to guarantee an improved user experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/STREAMLABS-OBS.jpg"                      alt="STREAMLABS OBS"                ></p><p>Like OBS, OBS Streamlabs Mac is free with a relatively easier installation process. Preceding the OBS Streamlabs Mac, it was available only on Windows and had app versions on Android and iOS. Notwithstanding, through Bootcamp, Mac owners could switch operating systems and use StreamLabs OBS.</p><p>In a blink, all settings are pre-configured and subscribers are directed to the Dashboard where major choices are made. After a few clicks, you are set to stream.</p><p>OBS Streamlabs Mac’s enhanced experience is by far unmatched by any other of its kind. An array of themes and advanced features allows each user to create his world through personalized—unique—layouts.</p><p>Exclusively, OBS Streamlab Mac provides alerts, text-to-speech automation, widgets, and layouts for free.</p><h2 id="Steps-to-Download-Streamlabs-OBS-on-Mac"><a href="#Steps-to-Download-Streamlabs-OBS-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Download Streamlabs OBS on Mac"></a>Steps to Download Streamlabs OBS on Mac</h2><p>Here are the easy steps to get OBS Streamlabs Mac working on your computer.</p><h3 id="1-Download-Streamlabs-OBS"><a href="#1-Download-Streamlabs-OBS" class="headerlink" title="1.

But, if you want to have a better experience, you will need more. A research and test results reveal that Periscope requires 10.4 MB for viewing a 2 minutes video on an average that is equal to <strong>5.2MB</strong> per minute. So, for faster live streaming, the data requirement on Periscope remains the same.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Get-A-Faster-And-Better-Live-Streaming-Quality"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Get-A-Faster-And-Better-Live-Streaming-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Get A Faster And Better Live Streaming Quality"></a>Part 3: How To Get A Faster And Better Live Streaming Quality</h2><p> Here, I am sharing few tips in order to fine-tune your expertise in video creation on Periscope and take your video live streaming to the next level. To reach the heights in broadcasting, the following streaming habits are essential to follow. With the increase in online video streaming and people getting more and more hooked on the live videos, try to follow the points below for a faster live streaming experience for your audiences.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2126492/26400" target="_top" id="2126492">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2126492" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="640" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2126492/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Delete-Cache-Files-On-Your-Phone"><a href="#Part-4-Delete-Cache-Files-On-Your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Delete Cache Files On Your Phone"></a>Part 4: Delete Cache Files On Your Phone</h2><p> The internet files and cache data covers a big space on your mobile phone. It weighs down your device making it heavy for any other videos to open. While closing a browser or a tab, the OS deletes thousands of small sized files that are automatically downloaded in order to open the web pages. When you do not close the browsers properly and shut down your device, the files stored automatically weighs down the browser, effecting faster live streaming and loading speed. Thus, prior to doing live streaming, open the browser settings and delete the recently used history and other provisional Internet files in order to increase live streaming speed.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Connect-WIFI-When-It-Is-Available"><a href="#Part-5-Connect-WIFI-When-It-Is-Available" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Connect WIFI When It Is Available"></a>Part 5: Connect WIFI When It Is Available</h2><p> For any heavy file download or live streaming, mobile data usage can ruin your experience and it is also too much consuming, whether data or time. However, with WIFI, the live streaming becomes easy and seamless. Generally, if you check the speed, the WiFi is much faster than normal mobile data speed. So, it is always recommended to connect the wifi whenever and wherever available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/connect-wifi.JPG"                      alt="connect wifi"                ></p><h2 id="Part-6-Use-Third-Party-App"><a href="#Part-6-Use-Third-Party-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Use Third-Party App"></a>Part 6: Use Third-Party App</h2><p> If you want a faster live streaming on Periscope, the third-party apps like Speedify can be of great help to increase live streaming speed and improve live stream quality. Poor internet speed can completely destroy your Periscope experience. A reliable and fast mobile connectivity has become crucial for live streaming on Periscope. With the new feature of broadcasting completely handsfree, Periscope requires an adequate bandwidth for live streaming. So, the third-party apps are the best ways to ensure a seamless connection on your mobile and faster live streaming.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134494/18498" target="_top" id="2134494">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134494" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="721" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134494/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> We are all aware of the importance of the Internet speed in the recent times. If you have a faster live streaming speed, your experience will obviously get better.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Color-Space-Comparison-Srgb-vs-Rgb"><a href="#Color-Space-Comparison-Srgb-vs-Rgb" class="headerlink" title="Color Space Comparison: Srgb vs Rgb"></a>Color Space Comparison: Srgb vs Rgb</h2><p>You might have seen the phrase “color space” in your preferred post-processing program or camera settings. It alludes to the spectrum of colors that a photograph is capable of displaying. The two most popular color spaces are typically sRGB and Adobe RGB.</p><p>It’s critical to understand the differences between these color spaces because they aren’t always equivalent. Every option has scenarios when it is more suitable than others. Let’s compare the sRGB and Adobe RGB color spaces and examine how these concepts are used in photography. Let’s start!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-sRGB"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-sRGB" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is sRGB?"></a>Part 1. What Is sRGB?</h2><p>Microsoft and HP created the sRGB RGB color space specifically for digital use. For computer screens and other digital devices like tablets and smartphones, it is the best color space to use. sRGB is now the standard color space as a result. SRGB is used by anything with computer-like skills.</p><p>All devices show sRGB images reliably, and it is easy to use. Additionally, it works well for printing from your neighborhood color lab. A computer monitor can display the majority of the sRGB color space, but only roughly 3&#x2F;4 of the Adobe RGB color space.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-Adobe-RGB"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-Adobe-RGB" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What Is Adobe RGB?"></a>Part 2. What Is Adobe RGB?</h2><p>Adobe created Adobe RGB so that it would work with CMYK printers. It contains the same number of colors as sRGB, as was already explained, but they are distributed differently. So if you want to print your work properly, it gives you a wider range of vivid color to work with. Their main advantage is this. They can also be changed at any time to sRGB.</p><p>You’ll see that when you submit a photo with an Adobe RGB color space to the web, the results appear flat and desaturated. This is due to the color being converted to sRGB by your browser. You should convert your files yourself before posting them because it does this fairly poorly.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Which-color-space-is-the-best"><a href="#Part-3-Which-color-space-is-the-best" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Which color space is the best?"></a>Part 3. Which color space is the best?</h2><p>The color space that best suits your needs is, as you might expect, the ideal color space. I advise setting your camera’s color space to Adobe RGB. This will provide you with a larger range of colors to work with while editing and enable you to convert your files to sRGB later if you wish. Adobe RGB files are fantastic because it’s simple to change them into sRGB for screen use. If you’ve ever sent pictures to stock photo agencies, for instance, you know that they typically want them in the Adobe RGB color space. The reason for this is that a customer acquiring a photo license has the option of printing the file or converting it to sRGB for usage on the web. Given that Adobe RGB’s color spectrum is wider, you have more alternatives. Color space will also be influenced by your display. A larger color gamut is displayed on some monitors than on others. A similar number of colors are present in both SRGB and Adobe RGB, however, sRGB has a smaller color space. According to reports, Adobe RGB has a 35% broader color spectrum than sRGB.</p><p>Professional printers also have preferences when it comes to the color spaces they need. Save your files in the Adobe RGB color space if you mostly operate in web form but believe that you may need the greater color gamut that Adobe RGB can offer in the future.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080342/19272" target="_top" id="2080342">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080342" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080342/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-FAQs-about-RGB"><a href="#Part-4-FAQs-about-RGB" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

But the big question is ‘If your audience doesn’t turn on the sound of your videos, how do they get the message you’re trying to pass?” Well, this is why adding ‘Subtitles’ to your videos is crucial. However, for a subtitle to work, it needs to comply with the structure of a video player or any platform you intend to use it on. And fortunately, SRT is a universal format, making it usable on any social media platform.</p><p>In this guide, you’ll be introduced to the simple methods you can utilize to upload SRT files to social media platforms including YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, etc. But before we proceed, let’s take a look at an overview of the different social media platforms and the subtitle file formats they support.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Social Media Platform</th><th>SRT</th><th>VTT</th><th>STL</th><th>SSA</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>YouTube</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Vimeo</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>LinkedIn</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>From the overview table above, it’s obvious you can easily create one SRT file and easily use it on different social media channels. This saves you the stress of creating different subtitle files for each platform. So, without further ado, let’s dive in to find out how to upload and add .srt files to different social media platforms.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Upload-SRT-Files-to-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Upload-SRT-Files-to-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Upload SRT Files to YouTube Videos"></a>Part 1: Upload SRT Files to YouTube Videos</h2><p>If you’re a YouTube video content creator, but you still don’t know the benefit of adding subtitles to your videos, let’s give you the top two main hints on how subtitles affect your videos;</p><ul><li>Subtitles help your videos to be understood not only by folks who hear and see but also by folks who have hearing problems. Hence helping your video to reach more audience.</li><li>You need subtitles to make your videos SEO rich as phrases in your subtitle can be used as keywords by Google when users search for stuff related to your video online.</li></ul><p>That being said, keep in mind that SRT subtitles and CC are two different things. Although they are often used interchangeably, they are both distinct. The only similarity CC and SRT share is that they’re text version of the audio aspect of videos.</p><p>CC, also known as Close Caption the words spoken in the video, and it allows viewers understand the information being passed in a video without necessarily turning on the volume.</p><p>SRT subtitles, on the other hand, are translations of the word that’s spoken in a video. For example, if you’re streaming Korean movie, but you don’t understand the language, you’d need a translation of the dialogue at the bottom of your screen. The English translation that’s displayed on your screen is known as the SRT subtitles.</p><p>Now you know how subtitles affect your videos, and what the difference between SRT and CC are, let’s proceed to learn how to upload SRT files to YouTube videos.</p><p>Step1Sign in to your YouTube channel and locate the ‘YouTube Creator Studio’. Then select ‘Subtitles’ on the right menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-upload-srt-file-to-youtube-video-1.jpg"                      alt="subtitles"                ></p><p>Step2Select the Video that you want to add SRT to.

Hence helping your video to reach more audience.</li><li>You need subtitles to make your videos SEO rich as phrases in your subtitle can be used as keywords by Google when users search for stuff related to your video online.</li></ul><p>That being said, keep in mind that SRT subtitles and CC are two different things. Although they are often used interchangeably, they are both distinct. The only similarity CC and SRT share is that they’re text version of the audio aspect of videos.</p><p>CC, also known as Close Caption the words spoken in the video, and it allows viewers understand the information being passed in a video without necessarily turning on the volume.</p><p>SRT subtitles, on the other hand, are translations of the word that’s spoken in a video. For example, if you’re streaming Korean movie, but you don’t understand the language, you’d need a translation of the dialogue at the bottom of your screen. The English translation that’s displayed on your screen is known as the SRT subtitles.</p><p>Now you know how subtitles affect your videos, and what the difference between SRT and CC are, let’s proceed to learn how to upload SRT files to YouTube videos.</p><p>Step1Sign in to your YouTube channel and locate the ‘YouTube Creator Studio’.

We’ve assembled a guide to help you search, listen to, and download podcasts on your iPhone.</p><p>On your iPhone, open the Apple Podcasts app. Download it if you don’t already have it. After launching the application, look for the “Browse” button on the toolbar at the bottom. You may find out what’s hot or featured across several categories. Another option to find a podcast is to type its name into the “search” section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/listen-to-podcasts-on-your-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="search and browse option in apple podcast app"                ></p><p>When the results appear, tap on your chosen item to view more details.

Polarr provides essential features which help users take an ideal photo editing system for themselves. The following discusses some key features of this online tool.</p><h3 id="1-Adjustments-Within-Photos"><a href="#1-Adjustments-Within-Photos" class="headerlink" title="1.

Being referred to as Lightroom-style details and controls, this online editor makes a proficient entry across the existing market. It offers a white balance control, which does not come with an auto-slide control tool. However, managing the color and tone across Polarr is quite effective and unique.</p><p>Users can also mainly make proper tone adjustments with the help of shadows, highlights, white balancing, and black sliders.

What is a screenplay?</h2><p>A screenplay is a piece of writing that contains the dialogue for an entire film or television episode.</p><p>A screenplay can be based on original material, such as screenwriter ideas, or on pre-existing works, such as novels. The text is mostly dialogue, with descriptions of the environment, locations, scenery, costumes, and characters thrown in for good measure.</p><p>It can be used to ensure that everything in your story is consistent with what you’ve shot. It can also be used to assist with editing!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-1.jpg"                      alt="a screenplay"                ></p><p>A screenplay is a script for a film, television show, or play. It tells a story by using dialogue and action to show how the scenes are connected.</p><p>Are you considering writing a screenplay?</p><p>Are you wondering if it’s worth it?</p><p>This article will provide answers to your questions as well as resources to help you get started!</p><p>A screenplay is a story that describes what will be seen on film or television. They are written in a script format, which differs from novel writing.</p><p>The structure of a screenplay can differ depending on the type of film being produced and the amount of dialogue versus action.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Basic-standard-screenplay-formats"><a href="#Part-2-Basic-standard-screenplay-formats" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Basic standard screenplay formats"></a>Part 2. Basic standard screenplay formats</h2><p>Screenplay format is <strong>a collection of 12 different elements</strong>, and writers should keep in mind that formatting their screenplay will benefit them in the long run.</p><p>The first tip is to begin with Fade In, which is located at the top left of the page. This informs your reader of their location and serves as a template for what should be written in your script.</p><p>If you want to be a screenwriter, you must be familiar with the proper screenplay format. It is not sufficient to simply write the dialogue and action for your script.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-2.jpg"                      alt="basic standard screenplay formats"                ></p><p>You must also include all the other elements so that no one is confused about what each one means. Many factors must be considered when writing good screenplays, such as formatting to make the screenplay readable to others. The script should be formatted in accordance with industry standards, with adequate margins, spaces between dialogues and action lines, and so on, so that readers can easily follow it.</p><p>Screenplays are a type of written or visual storytelling in which <strong>dialogue, action, and description are all included</strong>. They are typically used in the film industry to pitch a film or television show idea. They can be either fiction or nonfiction, depending on whether they use fictional stories or real-life facts.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Templates-for-screenplay"><a href="#Part-3-Templates-for-screenplay" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Templates for screenplay"></a>Part 3. Templates for screenplay</h2><p>In simple words, a screenplay format template is a ready-made structure into which characters, movements, and story elements can be inserted to create a usable screenplay. It is essentially a layout with specific characteristics that suit a particular genre of screenwriting.</p><p>A psychological thriller script, for example, will have a different structure and pace than an action script. Both genres have storyboard templates that can be used for a variety of stories from each genre.</p><p>A thriller script template will structure character movement, staging, and dialogue delivery to look and move like an ideal thriller while preventing it from looking and moving like an action element.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-3.jpg"                      alt="templates for screenplay"                ></p><p>We currently have screenplay format templates for nearly every theatrical and film genre, including drama, comedy, action, thriller, autobiography, and others. Each of these templates has a unique structure, but the best ones share some characteristics.</p><h3 id="1-Characteristics-of-the-Ideal-Screenplay-Format-Template"><a href="#1-Characteristics-of-the-Ideal-Screenplay-Format-Template" class="headerlink" title="1. Characteristics of the Ideal Screenplay Format Template"></a>1. Characteristics of the Ideal Screenplay Format Template</h3><p>Regardless of the screenplay genre, each screenplay template has some characteristics that set it apart from the rest. However, all ideal scenarios have the following characteristics in common:</p><ul><li>Complex layout</li><li>Current features</li><li>Configurability</li><li>Creative space</li></ul><p>Let’s look at each of the characteristics individually.</p><h3 id="2-Comprehensive-Layout"><a href="#2-Comprehensive-Layout" class="headerlink" title="2. Comprehensive Layout"></a>2. Comprehensive Layout</h3><p>If you look at the screenplays for some of the greatest movies ever made, you’ll find that they all contain a complete and detailed story arc with textbook variations in pacing and dialogue as the story progresses.</p><p>Yes, almost all screenplays have some holes that may have been overlooked in the writing, but as a structure, they will include all the essential aspects of the story they are telling.</p><p>That said, a great screenplay format template:</p><ul><li>Format by genre</li><li>Have enough space for brainstorming and subject research</li><li>Layout of main acts, chapters, and scenes</li><li>Leave room for editing characters and settings (left margin and right margin variations)</li><li>Easy to use for beginners</li></ul><p>Aside from some niche genres like anthology and neo-bizarro, every ideal screenplay format template has some combination of these qualities.</p><h3 id="3-Contemporary-Features"><a href="#3-Contemporary-Features" class="headerlink" title="3. Contemporary Features"></a>3. Contemporary Features</h3><p>Scenarios have had a similar structure since the beginning of the last century.</p><p>The same title page, with the same standard Courier font, text indentation, scene title&#x2F;slug line and subtitle prefixes (INT-EXT), action line layout, etc. All this has remained unchanged over the years.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-4.jpg"                      alt="contemporary features"                ></p><p>However, with the advent of app-based screenwriting software, we have plenty of contemporary features such as automatic page numbers, time of day, parentheses, and pop-ups with specific character names.</p><p>Even the general rule of thumb “one-page equals one minute of screen time” doesn’t apply to all scripts today.</p><p>While it’s not necessary to have a fully automated script layout interface, any task that can be automated gives the writer more time for important tasks like contributing to off-screen production, recording voice-overs, etc.</p><p>Plus, since most writers today prefer a smartphone to a traditional typewriter, it pays to have a screenplay editor in the palm of your hand.</p><h3 id="4-Configurability"><a href="#4-Configurability" class="headerlink" title="4. Configurability"></a>4. Configurability</h3><p>Rigid script formatting risks making your story look and sound like all the stories that have used it in the past.</p><p>The same events, the same character archetypes, the same moves and submissions, and the same build-ups can quickly become boring.</p><p>The best storyboard templates have a structure that is created with the genre of the story in mind but gives the writer room to play around with their characters, setting, etc.</p><p>For example, when I’m writing a character who’s learning to write a book, I’d like to show her picking up references from nature and various other creative genres and coming back to change her style—not just research from the works of other writers.</p><p>Taking an unconventional approach to character development can seem counterproductive and time-consuming. However, a good script draft will allow the writer to do this without making the script unbalanced.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144308/7443" target="_top" id="2144308">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144308" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144308/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Creative-Space"><a href="#5-Creative-Space" class="headerlink" title="5. Creative Space"></a>5. Creative Space</h3><p>Stiffness is a very common factor in most traditional screenplay formats.</p><p>A certain rigidity is good because it keeps the story structured and prevents writers from focusing too deeply on one aspect and neglecting the rest.</p><p>However, script templates should not be too restrictive in terms of creative freedom for the writer.</p><p>For example, an ideal screenwriting template should allow one character out of several to experience a different phase of character development than the others at any point in the plot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-5.jpg"                      alt="creative space"                ></p><p>This prevents all characters from looking and sounding like they were cast from a similar mold and have no unique development of their own.</p><p>In addition, the best templates should allow screenwriters to adjust their plot development to write for feature films as well as series.</p><p>Common fictional tropes have already been adopted by thousands of screenwriters around the world. The job of a perfect template is to give you enough creative space to create a unique story from a traditional genre.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049379/7443" target="_top" id="2049379">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049379" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049379/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Make-your-own-screenplay-by-using-Filmora"><a href="#Part-4-Make-your-own-screenplay-by-using-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

This is an online photo editing tool from Adobe that can be used to generate memes very easily. While you can use Adobe Express to create a meme from scratch, the easiest way to create a meme is to choose from the numerous templates on the site.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/adobe-meme-templates.jpg"                      alt="adobe meme templates"                ></p><p>Once you choose a template, you can use Adobe Express to make changes to the template in various ways. This photo editor has a lot of features to help you make changes to the meme including editing the photos by replacing them with your images, editing the text by changing the font, and even changing the size of the entire meme.</p><p>The only problem with the meme templates that you find on Adobe Express is that they are not very well arranged. The home page is a list of templates of various genres and themes and you may find that it is quite a chore to find the unique template that you would like to use.</p><h2 id="ImgFlip-Meme-Template"><a href="#ImgFlip-Meme-Template" class="headerlink" title="ImgFlip Meme Template"></a>ImgFlip Meme Template</h2><p>If you are not looking to create highly sophisticated memes, ImgFlip is a great simple solution that you can use.

Copyright of Free Meme Templates</strong></p><p>Like every other type of content that you may see online, memes (even free meme templates) are copyrighted. But the reason you don’t hear about this is that meme copyright infringement is rarely enforced. Memes are relatively easy to create and cost next to nothing so pursuing litigation in copyright infringement may not be worth the cost. They are also widely available and it is difficult to figure out where they originated from.</p><p>If you are worried about the legal implications of using a free meme template, you can credit the creator of the meme whenever you use it. But because it can often be difficult to find out who created the meme, this may be very difficult. The only way to overcome these legal challenges may be to use some of the meme templates on this page to create your own meme that will be unique to you.</p><p><strong>2.
