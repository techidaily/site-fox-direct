The elements of drama are defined as the “key ingredients” of drama in the Arts in New Zealand Curriculum.</p><p>Radio drama contains the same elements as stage drama:</p><ul><li><strong>Role:</strong> characters in the game</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> when the event takes place</li><li><strong>Place:</strong> where the action takes place</li><li><strong>Action:</strong> what happens in the drama?</li><li><strong>Tension:</strong> conflict between characters and their surroundings</li><li><strong>Focus:</strong> the thoughts, feelings, or characters the playwright wants us to focus on at a particular moment.</li></ul><p>In radio drama, however, the playwright must inform us of the elements through various means, because we cannot get the information with our eyes. Radio drama is essentially heard, not seen.</p><h3 id="3-Radio-drama-features"><a href="#3-Radio-drama-features" class="headerlink" title="3. Radio drama features"></a>3. Radio drama features</h3><p><strong>The following are Radio Drama Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Radio drama uses sound to convey ideas to the audience. Audio can be in the form of dialogue, sound effects, or music.</li><li>Actors can play more than one role from moment to moment because only the voice needs to be changed.</li><li>Actors only use voice to express a character. They don’t need to use action, gestures, or facial expressions because the audience can’t see them.</li><li>There is no need for blocking or stage business in radio drama. However, actors may need to plan their movement to and from the microphone.</li><li>Radio playback can be set almost anywhere. There are no physical limits to overcome. Settings can easily be created with music and sound effects.</li><li>Radio drama contains a lot of dialogue. Since we can’t see what the actors are doing, they have to tell us what’s going on. The writer has to find ways for the characters to comment on where they are and what they and others are doing.</li><li>Radio scenes are often shorter than stage plays.</li><li>Radio drama must not be “live” in front of an audience. Radio drama is usually recorded and played back to an audience at a different time. This means that, just like in a movie, scenes don’t have to be played back-to-back and can be played more than once to get the best shot if needed. Drama can also be edited, and audio added.</li><li>Actors do not need to learn their lines. The actors can read their lines from the script because the audience can’t see it. Actors must be familiar with their lines and rehearsed how they will use their voice to tell the audience about the character and the action.</li><li>Radio drama usually features a small cast. A small number of characters are used in each scene because it is too difficult for the audience to distinguish between voices if there are many characters. The audience can also forget that a character is “on stage” if they don’t speak for a while because they can’t be seen. Because of this, the characters must speak quite often and be involved in the plot.</li><li>Radio drama is well suited for monologue and for plays where the setting is limited and physical action is not important, such as in a prison cell or cave.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-3-tips-for-writing-radio-drama-scripts"><a href="#Part-2-3-tips-for-writing-radio-drama-scripts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 tips for writing radio drama scripts"></a>Part 2. 3 tips for writing radio drama scripts</h2><p>Scriptwriting is a fundamental technique of creativity, whether for content production, copywriting, or art direction. Florida International University offers the Master of Science Creative Track in collaboration with the world-renowned portfolio school Miami Ad School. If you want to become a copywriter, the program is designed to hone your writing skills for a variety of communication styles and media, such as writing for video and audio content, TV and radio commercials, and the web.</p><p>Here are some tips to become a better audio-only content writer.</p><p>Writing a script allows you to control the content, structure, and flow of the program. If the show is unscripted and organic, the host will have talking points for reference. In addition to the script, you can also play with music and sound effects.</p><h3 id="1-Keep-your-scripts-clear"><a href="#1-Keep-your-scripts-clear" class="headerlink" title="1. Keep your scripts clear"></a>1. Keep your scripts clear</h3><p>Write the script while keeping it as simple as possible. Don’t fill your sentences with words that don’t add to what you’re trying to say.</p><p>Reading from a script can make you sound a little unnatural, as well as stiff and robotic. That is a huge error. When read aloud, the script should sound natural. A more formal approach and style can result in a show that sounds unnatural and is boring.</p><p>Radio has long been a popular form of entertainment, and radio dramas or plays are an excellent way for writers to express themselves. Original stories or adaptations of novels or plays can be used in radio dramas. Radio plays, like stage plays, have scenes, sequences, and acts, but they are not always structured the same way. Radio drama allows for a great deal of flexibility and creativity, and the medium of sound is also unique.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/radio-drama-scripts-2.jpg"                      alt="keep your scripts clear"                ></p><p>Novelists and screenwriters will need to alter their writing style to write for the ear rather than the eye. Listeners cannot read the previous line or skip ahead. Everything must make sense and be visualized by the listener at that time. To convey action and drama, use dialogue, sound effects, music, and even silence. This can be completed by including specific audio cues in your script so that the show’s creators understand your vision. Keep the script as brief as possible. There can never be too much prose or long-winded dialogue in radio plays. Everything must be brief, succinct, and to the point.</p><h3 id="2-Jump-right-into-the-action"><a href="#2-Jump-right-into-the-action" class="headerlink" title="2. Jump right into the action"></a>2. Jump right into the action</h3><p>Radio drama can be more difficult because it must immediately engage listeners, or they will lose interest and switch stations or channels. The first two minutes are crucial, so start your drama at the appropriate point in the story. The rule of thumb in the radio industry is ‘arrive late, leave early.’ This means you should enter the story at a later stage when the action has begun or when a crisis has occurred. Unlike books and movies, setting, building, and background details are not required. You can save the necessary details for later in the play.</p><p>Radio scripts, like scripts, must conform to industry standards for radio program producers to find the script usable. Include scripts for music, sound effects, silence, dialogue, and other audio needs in the game so that producers can see how the script will translate into the show. Include information for the actors as well, so they can bring your vision to life. For example, use adjectives to describe how they should sound when reading their lines - sad, angry, laughing, and so on. Also, keep the number of characters to a minimum and give each one a distinct voice and style.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/radio-drama-scripts-3.jpg"                      alt="jump right into the action"                ></p><h3 id="3-Make-It-Sound-Conversational"><a href="#3-Make-It-Sound-Conversational" class="headerlink" title="3. Make It Sound Conversational"></a>3. Make It Sound Conversational</h3><p>Whether fully scripted or not, audio programs are at their best when they sound natural. Make sure your grammar is concise and to the point so that you can improvise and expand on what you’ve written.</p><p>Write like you talk. A well-written script, read word for word, should be invisible to the listener. Your script must sound natural and relaxed. Read the script out loud or have someone read it.</p><p>Can’t find people ready to help? No problem, paste the script into your text-to-speech program. Wondershare Filmora has a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >text-to-speech <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>(TTS) feature. If you’re gasping in the middle of a sentence, shorten your sentences.</p><p>If the words are too difficult to express well or the meaning might be lost on the listener, try to use simple words whenever possible. Also, use free online tools like Hemingway Editor to help you identify complex sentences.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Some-famous-radio-dramas"><a href="#Part-3-Some-famous-radio-dramas" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Behind-The-Scenes-to-the-Best-FREE-Meme-Designs"><a href="#Behind-The-Scenes-to-the-Best-FREE-Meme-Designs" class="headerlink" title="Behind-The-Scenes to the Best FREE Meme Designs"></a>Behind-The-Scenes to the Best FREE Meme Designs</h2><p>When creating a meme, you will find that it is much easier to start with a pre-designed template. The creators of these temples take into account what is needed to create the perfect meme and even the dimensions needed to upload the meme to various social media sites. This eliminates a lot of work for you, allowing you to create a meme in a few minutes; after all, you can just select a pre-made template and change the images and text to suit your project’s needs.</p><p>In this article, we will be looking at some of the best places to find free meme templates that you can then use to create your memes. All the memes that you can find on all these sites are available to download and edit. If you want to create a meme from scratch, you can download the meme template and use a photo editor to change all aspects of the template.</p><h2 id="Canva-Meme-Theme"><a href="#Canva-Meme-Theme" class="headerlink" title="Canva Meme Theme"></a>Canva Meme Theme</h2><p>Canva is one of the most popular photo editing tools in the market and one of the things that Canva users love about this platform is the availability of templates. There is a meme template on Canva for any type of meme that you would like to create and once you have settled on the meme that you would like to use, you can then use the Canva editor to customize it as desired.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/canva-meme-theme.jpg"                      alt="canva meme theme"                ></p><p>Canva makes it very easy to find the template you need as the templates are arranged under various categories. You can also use various filters including filters, style, theme, price, and color to find the perfect template. Most of the themes on Canva are free but there are some advanced templates that you can access on a paid subscription or for a one-time fee.</p><p>The Canva editor has a lot of different features to allow you to edit your selected template in various ways. You can change the color, text font, and images or even re-orient the entire template so you end up with a unique meme to suit your needs.</p><h2 id="Kapwing-Meme-Templates"><a href="#Kapwing-Meme-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Kapwing Meme Templates"></a>Kapwing Meme Templates</h2><p>Kapwing is another online photo editing tool that also comes with a built-in meme generator. One of the benefits of choosing Kapwing is the numerous templates that you can use to create a unique meme. Each of the templates that you find on Kapwing is completely customizable. You can change the color of the existing images, add your images, change the text font and color and even remove or replace the meme’s background.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/kapwing-meme-templates.jpg"                      alt="kapwing meme templates"                ></p><p>Kapwing also makes it easy for you to find the templates that you need. All available templates on Kapwing are neatly arranged in various categories. The “Trending Now” category allows you to find memes that are relevant to the current market and may get you the best engagement.</p><h2 id="Adobe-Meme-Templates"><a href="#Adobe-Meme-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Adobe Meme Templates"></a>Adobe Meme Templates</h2><p>If you are looking to create unique and high-quality memes, Adobe Express is one of the best tools to use. This is an online photo editing tool from Adobe that can be used to generate memes very easily. While you can use Adobe Express to create a meme from scratch, the easiest way to create a meme is to choose from the numerous templates on the site.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/adobe-meme-templates.jpg"                      alt="adobe meme templates"                ></p><p>Once you choose a template, you can use Adobe Express to make changes to the template in various ways. This photo editor has a lot of features to help you make changes to the meme including editing the photos by replacing them with your images, editing the text by changing the font, and even changing the size of the entire meme.</p><p>The only problem with the meme templates that you find on Adobe Express is that they are not very well arranged. The home page is a list of templates of various genres and themes and you may find that it is quite a chore to find the unique template that you would like to use.</p><h2 id="ImgFlip-Meme-Template"><a href="#ImgFlip-Meme-Template" class="headerlink" title="ImgFlip Meme Template"></a>ImgFlip Meme Template</h2><p>If you are not looking to create highly sophisticated memes, ImgFlip is a great simple solution that you can use. There are thousands of meme templates to choose from, arranged in various genres and themes. Since the templates are added every day, the site has a very convenient search function that you can use to find the most reliable meme for your project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/imgflip-meme-template.jpg"                      alt="imgflip meme template"                ></p><p>But ImgFlip is not a complete photos editor, meaning that you may not able to change the template too much. The only thing you can do with this tool is to change the caption o the template which can be valuable if you find the right meme template. Once the caption has been added, you can then download the completed meme and then upload it to various social media sites.</p><h2 id="Wepik-Meme-Templates"><a href="#Wepik-Meme-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Wepik Meme Templates"></a>Wepik Meme Templates</h2><p>Wepik is another great site if you are looking for different types of memes to use. There are thousands of memes that you can choose from and they are updated every day, giving you a wide variety of choices. The most popular and the newest meme templates are available on the first page, but you can also use the search function to find a particular meme template that may not be on the home page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/wepik-meme-templates.jpg"                      alt="wepik meme templates"                ></p><p>Once you have selected the meme that you want to use, Wepik shows you details about the template you have chosen. You can then use the Wepik editor to customize the template in various ways. You can use numerous tools to change the color of the meme, edit the text on the meme or even edit the image. Once you are happy with the changes, you can then download the meme to post to your social media pages.</p><h2 id="Knowledge-of-Meme-Templates"><a href="#Knowledge-of-Meme-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Knowledge of Meme Templates"></a>Knowledge of Meme Templates</h2><p><strong>1. Copyright of Free Meme Templates</strong></p><p>Like every other type of content that you may see online, memes (even free meme templates) are copyrighted. But the reason you don’t hear about this is that meme copyright infringement is rarely enforced. Memes are relatively easy to create and cost next to nothing so pursuing litigation in copyright infringement may not be worth the cost. They are also widely available and it is difficult to figure out where they originated from.</p><p>If you are worried about the legal implications of using a free meme template, you can credit the creator of the meme whenever you use it. But because it can often be difficult to find out who created the meme, this may be very difficult. The only way to overcome these legal challenges may be to use some of the meme templates on this page to create your own meme that will be unique to you.</p><p><strong>2.

This model is designed to be a high-caliber Pro selection and a regular use work monitor that has all of the specs necessary for a variety of digital work tasks. If you are looking for a top quality 32-inch monitor for the use of everyday working tasks the UHD 4k monitor is near the top of many pro designers lists.</p><p><strong>Pros and Cons</strong></p><p> Overall this is a monitor that brings extensive value due to its LCD construction includes professional calibration software, and improved build quality, excellent styling for matching almost any office as well as an improved bright IPS panel, image quality, and Ultra HD resolutions.</p><p> The biggest problems that face this monitor are definitely the OSD calibration which is extremely inflexible; what’s more, the software which does not support the use of high-end instruments or even PC sharing with one keyboard and mouse. Other top-quality professional monitors do include the use of these features but they are also considerably more expensive.</p><h2 id="Asus-PA-329Q-Design-Quality"><a href="#Asus-PA-329Q-Design-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Asus PA 329Q Design Quality"></a>Asus PA 329Q Design Quality</h2><h4 id="1-Design-Style"><a href="#1-Design-Style" class="headerlink" title="1.Design Style"></a>1.Design Style</h4><p> The overall design of this device includes a 360° rotation for portrait mode, a sturdy and unique stand as well as a height adjustable operation. This is the type of monitor that you can use for ergonomic support day in and day out. The overall design style is made from modern office and it can be made to fit in almost any environment. Including eight ergonomic swivel, pivot, height adjustment and more is an ideal choice for many professionals who are looking for a monitor that they can use for preventing neck strain and improving long working hours each day.</p><p> The look of this monitor also comes with a beautiful logo that improves the branding of the monitor as well as strong materials all finished in matte black. This matte black construction really helps to improve the look of the monitor overall and to make sure that it can fade into almost any office setting. The cabinet finish features a 10 mm bezel which is not too distracting and ensures that if multiple monitors needed to be used for one workstation this could be done quite easily. Overall the monitor size is great and with the design of the adjustments it’s really easy to enjoy a functional design that goes far beyond the average 32 inch television or large display. The comfort adjustments on this make it perfect for professionals.</p><p> The stand and base are manufactured and extremely minimalist design which is functional yet extremely strong and study. This ensures that the entire unit can stand up quite well in a large office or across many cubicles and hours of work. The PA329Q is known for being adjustable in every way that an ASUS is providing for all of its 4 k monitors. If you have used one of these monitors in the past they can be extremely comfortable over long uses making them ideal for a workplace setting.</p><h4 id="2-Ports-and-Connectivity"><a href="#2-Ports-and-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="2. Ports and Connectivity"></a>2. Ports and Connectivity</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-proart-pa329q-ports.jpg"                      alt="asus-proart-pa329q-ports"                ></p><p> The PA 329Q has almost any type of port that you might require in a workplace including four HDMI version 2.0 ports, mini display port 1.2 a standard display port 1.2 as well as five USB 3.0 ports, a nine in one card reader as well as an earphone jack.</p><p> Most of these ports are located directly underneath the monitor, and the only problem with this is that it can often lead to troubles with cord management. While most of the ports can be easily viewed by tilting the monitor, sometimes it can be difficult to plug items in for connectivity without first raising the monitor up or even tilting it all the way down. Once you have the monitor configured and everything plugged in, it’s quite easy to use for day to day operations.</p><p> The overall design of the ports and the location of these ports is for a minimalist design with the look of many items, such as cords and empty ports hidden away from view. Most of the settings and button features can be found along the side of the monitor where they can sometimes be hidden from view. When using the monitor in portrait mode these ports become much more accessible. For most high-end monitors, these types of ports are expected but it’s tough to find too many monitors that have such a wealth of ports available for use at one time.</p><h2 id="Features-and-Performance"><a href="#Features-and-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Features and Performance"></a>Features and Performance</h2><h4 id="1-OSD-and-Settings"><a href="#1-OSD-and-Settings" class="headerlink" title="1.OSD and Settings"></a>1.OSD and Settings</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-proart-pa329q-osd.jpg"                      alt="asus-proart-pa329q-osd"                ></p><p> The overall settings are handled by joystick navigation through the large OSD. There are many color options including quick fit resolution, a full menu of color options, input selections, blue light filters calibration tools and more. For the most part, calibration can be done with splendid menus which are available just out of the box. Additional features can also be found throughout the menu to improve connectivity and the use of the menus throughout usage. There is even an option to create alignments based off of actual paper sizes so that you can create very precise editing and proofing on documents before they print.</p><p> There are eight different picture modes available throughout the settings including sRBG, Adobe RPG and a variety of other factory settings. Putting locks into the brightness as well as color can make sure that full adjustments stay through multiple shifts and working conditions. Blue light filters also come with four different options ensuring that you can get compensation based off of the types of color settings you work best with. The color menu adjustments include sliders for all six colors and under the advanced submenu, there are some fine tuning adjustments that you won’t find on many other types of professional monitors.</p><p> The remaining types of picture controls can be found throughout the image submenu which allows for adjustments in sharpness, overscan, aspect control toggles and more. The Vivid Pixel enhancement option also allows for improved contrast between dark and light objects across the screen. The dynamic feature will improve the range of shadows for animation work for example.</p><h4 id="2-Color-and-Image-Quality"><a href="#2-Color-and-Image-Quality" class="headerlink" title="2. Color and Image Quality"></a>2. Color and Image Quality</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-proart-pa329q-rgb.jpg"                      alt="asus-proart-pa329q-rgb"                ></p><p> Overall this is a monitor designed for professional use and includes a wide color gamut of 100% REC .709, 99.5% Adobe RGB, wide color gamut for vibrant images and more. There are color spaces for video editing in 2020 as well as true to life color reproduction.</p><p> What’s really incredible with the color and image quality is the full customization that is available to professionals. Through the menus, it’s possible to change brightness settings, calibrate for animation and improved contrast as well as deliver improved support for working within Adobe and other video editing and production suites.</p><p> This device can produce 1.0 7 billion colors with the chance to produce over 1024 shades of each primary color. The screen is made up of a 10-bit panel and there is a 14-bit lookup table for a huge color gamut. There is also amazing gamma correction and color recalculation to represent the differences between colors and to finally produce a true to life image based off of the closest specifications and measurements on a print product.</p><p> Overall the image quality and color quality is perfect especially when the settings are dialed in the only aspect where this monitor falls short however is with brightness uniformity. Even many of the top Asus monitors find difficulty with uniformity compensation throughout the monitor face and this makes brightness at a fixed level of premium. The pure resolution and the size of the monitor ensures that pixels are close to invisible and the antiglare matte coating on the monitor makes it easy to read and easy to see colors in a variety of different lighting settings.</p><h4 id="3-Calibration"><a href="#3-Calibration" class="headerlink" title="3. Calibration"></a>3. Calibration</h4><p> Overall this monitor is extremely easy to work on right out-of-the-box. The calibration technology on ASUS however has always been a cut above. The PA329Q delivers DCI PIII color space support. The device also comes with a factory data calibration sheet ensuring that artists and creative professionals can calibrate specifically for Adobe RGB modes, s RGB modes and the latest in industry standards. The ASUS proARt calibration technology software also comes with all of the latest presets for editing software worldwide. New standards and improvements can be constantly fed through the software to ensure improved performance results.</p><p> As well as the features the color calibration tools that ASUS included just in the menu with the PA329Q make it extremely easy to calibrate in its multiple picture modes as well as through advanced settings that can all be found on the monitor.</p><h4 id="4-Eye-Care-Mode"><a href="#4-Eye-Care-Mode" class="headerlink" title="4.Eye Care Mode"></a>4.Eye Care Mode</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-proart-pa329q-protect-flicker.jpg"                      alt="asus-proart-pa329q-protect-flicker"                ></p><p> In eye care mode the Asus offers a flicker free operation with a low blue light. The idea of this type of technology is to produce a beautiful image quality with very high refresh rates. This can work to protect the eyes over a long shift and prevent dry eye symptoms that are common amongst design and image editing professionals. This type of technology is an ASUS only creation and it shows they are willing to go a step beyond for creative professionals.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Overall this is a top quality professional monitor due to both of its performance, the hardware and the amazing amount of settings that are available under the hood.

What makes TED different is its story-driven narration. This is evident in their most viewed content, such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU" >Inside the mind of a master procrastinator - by Tim Urban <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h3 id="2-Internet-Historian"><a href="#2-Internet-Historian" class="headerlink" title="2) Internet Historian"></a>2) Internet Historian</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/popular-youtube-storytelling-channels-3.jpg"                      alt="youtube storytelling channels image"                ></p><p><strong><em>Subscriber Count: &lt;3 million</em></strong></p><p>Internet historian is probably one of the best storytellers on YouTube.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Aural-Tales-The-Best-of-Radio-Plays"><a href="#Aural-Tales-The-Best-of-Radio-Plays" class="headerlink" title="Aural Tales: The Best of Radio Plays"></a>Aural Tales: The Best of Radio Plays</h2><p>A radio drama is <strong>a fictional work that is broadcast on the radio</strong>. It is entirely acoustic, with no visual elements. The dialogue, sound effects, and music help the audience understand what is going on. They shape the story by imagining the settings and characters.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Everything-about-Radio-Drama-Scripts"><a href="#Part-1-Everything-about-Radio-Drama-Scripts" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Everything about Radio Drama Scripts"></a>Part 1. Everything about Radio Drama Scripts</h2><p>A radio play script is written in a specific format that allows the playwright to convey how sound and music will be used in the performance. For example, one page of dialogue equals about one minute of airtime. Each scene should be labeled with a number. Normally, lines are double-spaced.</p><h3 id="1-What-are-radio-drama-scripts"><a href="#1-What-are-radio-drama-scripts" class="headerlink" title="1. What are radio drama scripts?"></a>1. What are radio drama scripts?</h3><p>A radio drama is a presentation of a fictional work distributed on the radio. It is completely acoustic with no visual components. The audience understands what is happening through dialogue, sound effects, and music. They give form to the story by visualizing the environment and characters.</p><p>Audio dramas can be works of fiction written expressly for radio broadcasting or podcasting. Alternatively, they can be adapted from plays, novels, short stories, etc.</p><p>Now there is often a need to write audio dramas specifically for radio, as stage plays rely on what the audience can see on stage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/radio-drama-scripts-1.jpg"                      alt="radio drama scripts"                ></p><h3 id="2-Elements-of-radio-drama"><a href="#2-Elements-of-radio-drama" class="headerlink" title="2. Elements of radio drama"></a>2. Elements of radio drama</h3><p>Drama’s elements are its fundamental building blocks. The elements of drama are defined as the “key ingredients” of drama in the Arts in New Zealand Curriculum.</p><p>Radio drama contains the same elements as stage drama:</p><ul><li><strong>Role:</strong> characters in the game</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> when the event takes place</li><li><strong>Place:</strong> where the action takes place</li><li><strong>Action:</strong> what happens in the drama?</li><li><strong>Tension:</strong> conflict between characters and their surroundings</li><li><strong>Focus:</strong> the thoughts, feelings, or characters the playwright wants us to focus on at a particular moment.</li></ul><p>In radio drama, however, the playwright must inform us of the elements through various means, because we cannot get the information with our eyes. Radio drama is essentially heard, not seen.</p><h3 id="3-Radio-drama-features"><a href="#3-Radio-drama-features" class="headerlink" title="3. Radio drama features"></a>3. Radio drama features</h3><p><strong>The following are Radio Drama Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Radio drama uses sound to convey ideas to the audience. Audio can be in the form of dialogue, sound effects, or music.</li><li>Actors can play more than one role from moment to moment because only the voice needs to be changed.</li><li>Actors only use voice to express a character. They don’t need to use action, gestures, or facial expressions because the audience can’t see them.</li><li>There is no need for blocking or stage business in radio drama. However, actors may need to plan their movement to and from the microphone.</li><li>Radio playback can be set almost anywhere. There are no physical limits to overcome. Settings can easily be created with music and sound effects.</li><li>Radio drama contains a lot of dialogue. Since we can’t see what the actors are doing, they have to tell us what’s going on. The writer has to find ways for the characters to comment on where they are and what they and others are doing.</li><li>Radio scenes are often shorter than stage plays.</li><li>Radio drama must not be “live” in front of an audience. Radio drama is usually recorded and played back to an audience at a different time. This means that, just like in a movie, scenes don’t have to be played back-to-back and can be played more than once to get the best shot if needed. Drama can also be edited, and audio added.</li><li>Actors do not need to learn their lines. The actors can read their lines from the script because the audience can’t see it. Actors must be familiar with their lines and rehearsed how they will use their voice to tell the audience about the character and the action.</li><li>Radio drama usually features a small cast. A small number of characters are used in each scene because it is too difficult for the audience to distinguish between voices if there are many characters. The audience can also forget that a character is “on stage” if they don’t speak for a while because they can’t be seen. Because of this, the characters must speak quite often and be involved in the plot.</li><li>Radio drama is well suited for monologue and for plays where the setting is limited and physical action is not important, such as in a prison cell or cave.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-3-tips-for-writing-radio-drama-scripts"><a href="#Part-2-3-tips-for-writing-radio-drama-scripts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 tips for writing radio drama scripts"></a>Part 2. 3 tips for writing radio drama scripts</h2><p>Scriptwriting is a fundamental technique of creativity, whether for content production, copywriting, or art direction. Florida International University offers the Master of Science Creative Track in collaboration with the world-renowned portfolio school Miami Ad School. If you want to become a copywriter, the program is designed to hone your writing skills for a variety of communication styles and media, such as writing for video and audio content, TV and radio commercials, and the web.</p><p>Here are some tips to become a better audio-only content writer.</p><p>Writing a script allows you to control the content, structure, and flow of the program. If the show is unscripted and organic, the host will have talking points for reference. In addition to the script, you can also play with music and sound effects.</p><h3 id="1-Keep-your-scripts-clear"><a href="#1-Keep-your-scripts-clear" class="headerlink" title="1. Keep your scripts clear"></a>1. Keep your scripts clear</h3><p>Write the script while keeping it as simple as possible. Don’t fill your sentences with words that don’t add to what you’re trying to say.</p><p>Reading from a script can make you sound a little unnatural, as well as stiff and robotic. That is a huge error. When read aloud, the script should sound natural. A more formal approach and style can result in a show that sounds unnatural and is boring.</p><p>Radio has long been a popular form of entertainment, and radio dramas or plays are an excellent way for writers to express themselves. Original stories or adaptations of novels or plays can be used in radio dramas. Radio plays, like stage plays, have scenes, sequences, and acts, but they are not always structured the same way. Radio drama allows for a great deal of flexibility and creativity, and the medium of sound is also unique.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/radio-drama-scripts-2.jpg"                      alt="keep your scripts clear"                ></p><p>Novelists and screenwriters will need to alter their writing style to write for the ear rather than the eye. Listeners cannot read the previous line or skip ahead. Everything must make sense and be visualized by the listener at that time. To convey action and drama, use dialogue, sound effects, music, and even silence. This can be completed by including specific audio cues in your script so that the show’s creators understand your vision. Keep the script as brief as possible. There can never be too much prose or long-winded dialogue in radio plays. Everything must be brief, succinct, and to the point.</p><h3 id="2-Jump-right-into-the-action"><a href="#2-Jump-right-into-the-action" class="headerlink" title="2. Jump right into the action"></a>2. Jump right into the action</h3><p>Radio drama can be more difficult because it must immediately engage listeners, or they will lose interest and switch stations or channels. The first two minutes are crucial, so start your drama at the appropriate point in the story. The rule of thumb in the radio industry is ‘arrive late, leave early.’ This means you should enter the story at a later stage when the action has begun or when a crisis has occurred. Unlike books and movies, setting, building, and background details are not required. You can save the necessary details for later in the play.</p><p>Radio scripts, like scripts, must conform to industry standards for radio program producers to find the script usable. Include scripts for music, sound effects, silence, dialogue, and other audio needs in the game so that producers can see how the script will translate into the show. Include information for the actors as well, so they can bring your vision to life. For example, use adjectives to describe how they should sound when reading their lines - sad, angry, laughing, and so on. Also, keep the number of characters to a minimum and give each one a distinct voice and style.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/radio-drama-scripts-3.jpg"                      alt="jump right into the action"                ></p><h3 id="3-Make-It-Sound-Conversational"><a href="#3-Make-It-Sound-Conversational" class="headerlink" title="3. Make It Sound Conversational"></a>3. Make It Sound Conversational</h3><p>Whether fully scripted or not, audio programs are at their best when they sound natural. Make sure your grammar is concise and to the point so that you can improvise and expand on what you’ve written.</p><p>Write like you talk. A well-written script, read word for word, should be invisible to the listener. Your script must sound natural and relaxed. Read the script out loud or have someone read it.</p><p>Can’t find people ready to help? No problem, paste the script into your text-to-speech program. Wondershare Filmora has a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >text-to-speech <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>(TTS) feature. If you’re gasping in the middle of a sentence, shorten your sentences.</p><p>If the words are too difficult to express well or the meaning might be lost on the listener, try to use simple words whenever possible. Also, use free online tools like Hemingway Editor to help you identify complex sentences.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Some-famous-radio-dramas"><a href="#Part-3-Some-famous-radio-dramas" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

It might seem that way but it is not. The choice of MKV player for Mac will depend upon you, which is why you should read about them first. Out of the many options available, some of the known ones are listed down below.</p><h3 id="1-VLC-Media-Player"><a href="#1-VLC-Media-Player" class="headerlink" title="1. VLC Media Player"></a>1.

Last but not least, you can directly access videos on Dailymotion, Vimeo, and YouTube in the media player.</p><p>Luckily, there are not many cons of this player except that you will not be able to run it on older devices. Moreover, some of the features are absent from the regular version and are only offered in the Pro version of the player.</p><h3 id="3-5KPlayer"><a href="#3-5KPlayer" class="headerlink" title="3. 5KPlayer"></a>3. 5KPlayer</h3><p>The theme today is to provide you with ease which is why another free MKV player for Mac is being introduced.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/5kplayer-for-mkv-files.jpg"                      alt="5kplayer for mkv files"                ></p><p>The user experience with the 5K player is mostly rated positively owing to its many viewing options like AirPlay, extracting high-quality audio files, or even directly downloading videos from the internet available in HD.</p><p>The file format compatibility of the player is high and that is how it caters to a large population of users.

MPlayerX"></a>4. MPlayerX</h3><p>All users of the MacOS system swear by MPlayerX. As a Mac user, you will immediately recognize the sleek OS system design with attractive keys.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/mplayerx-for-mkv-files.jpg"                      alt="mplayerx for mkv files"                ></p><p>You will truly enjoy working with this MKV player for Mac due to its useful functions.

Even with the user-friendly look and features, the player does not offer an easy to use playlist feature either.</p><h3 id="5-DivX-Plus"><a href="#5-DivX-Plus" class="headerlink" title="5. DivX Plus"></a>5. DivX Plus</h3><p>In keeping with the tradition of suggesting you a free MKV player, the last on the list is DivX Plus which is somewhat a diva of the media player world.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/divx-plus-for-mkv-files.jpg"                      alt="divx plus for mkv files"                ></p><p>It is a media player that does almost everything. With this MKV player for Mac, you will be able to convert your videos, have a web browser plug-in at your hand, and a codec pack too.</p><p>The look of it is supremely stylish and the features are easy to grasp and use. A disadvantage that comes to mind is that it is not user-friendly at all when it comes to streaming video options.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>All the media players listed above are top-notch but you cannot easily trim, cut or crop videos with them.

Malware infections and potentially unwanted programs are an outcome of downloading from an unreliable source. There are many websites that specialize in dispersing malicious payloads by providing the downloader with something legitimate or bundling the required installer with some extra programs.</p><p>There are many threat initiators who look for the terms that are gaining popularity in the search results and seek out the terminated software downloads. Thereafter, they try to attract searchers to the website. These people use SEO techniques for ranking higher in the search engines. As a matter of fact, they might also spend a few dollars to show up in the search engine’s sponsored section. These sites hide their malware in the malvertising as downloads.</p><p>The threat actors just make sure that the searchers believe that they have found what they are looking for. If they are convinced, they are going to download and install the infected driver all by themselves. The threat actor just uploads the malware under a file name that will be convincing enough for attracting visitors to the website.</p><p>Section1. <a href="#s1">How to Assess a Website?</a></p><p>Section2. <a href="#s2">Tips to Filter Malware from the VLC Download Files for Mac</a></p><p>Section3. <a href="#s3">Top Websites to Download VLC Player for Mac for Free</a></p><p>Section4. <a href="#s4">How to Download and Install VLC Player on Mac?

This shows that the site has got a security certificate. However, this isn’t a guarantee that the website is safe for downloading the VLC player software.</p><p>SSL certificates come at a cheap price and a cybercriminal knows where they can get them almost for free. So, click on the green padlock to find out who has issued the certificate. You can also check the other sites that have received their SSL certificate from this particular authority.</p><h3 id="•-Use-a-Browser-Extension-or-a-Trusted-Anti-Virus-Software"><a href="#•-Use-a-Browser-Extension-or-a-Trusted-Anti-Virus-Software" class="headerlink" title="• Use a Browser Extension or a Trusted Anti-Virus Software"></a>• Use a Browser Extension or a Trusted Anti-Virus Software</h3><p>There are many free applications and browser extensions that will warn you about shady sites. This software can alert you when you try to open a site that they know to be the home of scammers and malware. Install such software or add it to your browser to recognize malicious sites and domains.</p><h3 id="•-Read-Third-Party-Reviews"><a href="#•-Read-Third-Party-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="• Read Third-Party Reviews"></a>• Read Third-Party Reviews</h3><p>There are some websites where you will find reviews on the download domains and sites. Albeit, some of these sites are reputable, they might fall behind when it comes to adding new users. Cybercriminals can dump a new domain just like that when it gets too many bad reviews and then purchase a new site from where they can run their scheme. So, when you are reading reviews, make sure that you are choosing sites that have been around for some time.</p><p>In case a site doesn’t have reviews, it means it has only started operating and it might be up to no good.</p><h2 id="Section-2-Tips-to-Filter-Malware-from-the-VLC-Download-Files-for-Mac"><a href="#Section-2-Tips-to-Filter-Malware-from-the-VLC-Download-Files-for-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Section 2.Tips to Filter Malware from the VLC Download Files for Mac"></a>Section 2.Tips to Filter Malware from the VLC Download Files for Mac</h2><p>There are a few methods that you can use to weed out the malware from the downloaded files.</p><h3 id="•-Check-The-Digital-Signature-Of-The-File"><a href="#•-Check-The-Digital-Signature-Of-The-File" class="headerlink" title="• Check The Digital Signature Of The File"></a>• Check The Digital Signature Of The File</h3><p>The digital signature of a file can be verified after you have downloaded it.

Hence, you should just accept a website to be trustworthy and download the VLC file simply because it features the logo of a trustworthy company on the homepage. Logo images are available online and they can be planted on a malware site.</p><h3 id="•-Compare-the-Checksum-To-The-Actual-File"><a href="#•-Compare-the-Checksum-To-The-Actual-File" class="headerlink" title="• Compare the Checksum To The Actual File"></a>• Compare the Checksum To The Actual File</h3><p>A checksum is actually a sequence of letters or numbers used for checking data for errors.

Is the lighting correct? Is the focus autofocus or manual? Is the background distracting from the subject? But there’s another thing you should be thinking about: camera shake. If you’ve ever looked at pictures online and thought they’re blurred - that’s probably because of camera shake. This isn’t always easy to get rid of post-production if you’ve filmed on a DSLR camera, so it’s better to get it right in camera. A few different things cause a camera shake, so here we’ll take a look at what causes this and how you can stop it from happening when taking your next photograph.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-1.jpg"                      alt="camera shake effect"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">The Definition of Camera Shake</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Is Camera Shake A Bad Thing?</a></p><h2 id="The-Definition-of-Camera-Shake"><a href="#The-Definition-of-Camera-Shake" class="headerlink" title="The Definition of Camera Shake"></a>The Definition of Camera Shake</h2><p>Camera shake is the camera’s movement during the exposure of a photograph. This can be caused by either a badly mounted camera or because the shutter speed was too slow for the lens’s focal length. Camera shake is most noticeable when you shoot at telephoto focal lengths and at high magnifications (zoomed in) with a long exposure time.</p><h3 id="In-Pictures"><a href="#In-Pictures" class="headerlink" title="In Pictures"></a>In Pictures</h3><p>Anyone who takes pictures seriously will eventually face the problem of camera shake. This happens when the camera shakes during exposure due to the photographer pushing the shutter button or a shaky hand. This can result in blurry photos, but there are several ways to avoid it in most situations. Camera shake is one of the most common problems photographers and videographers face and is one of the easiest to fix.</p><h3 id="In-Videos"><a href="#In-Videos" class="headerlink" title="In Videos"></a>In Videos</h3><p>Videos are made up of individual frames, each capturing one moment in time. When your video contains a scene that moves from left to right, the frames that make up that scene move from left to right as well. If there’s any movement in the frame except for horizontal movements, such as vertical movement caused by camera shake, you’ll see it in every frame of your video.</p><h2 id="Is-Camera-Shake-A-Bad-Thing"><a href="#Is-Camera-Shake-A-Bad-Thing" class="headerlink" title="Is Camera Shake A Bad Thing?"></a>Is Camera Shake A Bad Thing?</h2><p>So, is camera shake a bad thing? Yes, most of the time, but there are times when you can actually use it to your advantage. For example, in a long exposure shot, you may want to introduce some camera shake on purpose to blur moving objects and create a creative effect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-2.jpg"                      alt="is camera shake a bad thing"                ></p><p>Another example where a camera shake can work in your favour is handheld macro photography. When shooting handheld macro shots, the motion of your hands can help keep the lens aligned with an object in front of you—if you move too slowly, the lens might lose alignment with what you’re shooting.</p><p>So if you find yourself facing a situation where you don’t have a tripod or monopod handy, and you need steady shots, try using different techniques like bracing your body against solid objects or using burst mode to capture multiple images and choosing the sharpest one from the bunch.</p><h3 id="In-Pictures-1"><a href="#In-Pictures-1" class="headerlink" title="In Pictures"></a>In Pictures</h3><p>A camera shake is a big problem for most photographers. It’s the enemy of sharp images, and when you’re shooting with a telephoto lens, even the smallest amount of camera shake can cause blurry images.</p><p>A camera shake is generally a bad thing when you’re shooting still photography. It can cause your images to be blurry (and therefore unusable), and the more you zoom in, the more pronounced that effect is.</p><p>If you’re shooting with a tripod, you’ll know if you have a camera shake if the image looks blurry. If it does, don’t worry — there are ways to fix it in post-processing. But it’s better to not have to do that in the first place!</p><p>There are various ways in which the camera can shake, but the important thing is that this is generally undesirable. If you’re into abstract expressionism or “happy accidents”, you may disagree with the latter statement, and that’s your prerogative!</p><p>It is usually preferable for the rest of us to have photos that aren’t blurry due to camera shake. When we say “blurry,” we’re not referring to the depth of field or out-of-focus shots. Those are two entirely different things.</p><h3 id="In-Videos-1"><a href="#In-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="In Videos"></a>In Videos</h3><p>Many people already know about camera shake when it comes to photography. If you’re taking a picture and your shutter speed is too slow, or you don’t have a tripod handy, or your hands aren’t steady enough, that can cause blur in your pictures. The same thing can happen when shooting a video. There are many times when camera shake is used as an artistic effect in videos.</p><p>Like many filmmaking techniques, you’re going to want to shoot plenty of footage and then pick the perfect clips later. However, when it comes to camera shake, you’re better off overdoing it with your takes than underdoing it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-3.jpg"                      alt="is camera shake a bad thing in video"                ></p><p>A great way to add energy and intensity to your shots is camera movement. Whether you are walking with your camera or running, a bit of shake in your footage can give a sense of excitement and urgency to your shots.</p><p>However, when shooting video, camera shake is often used as an artistic effect. A lot of Hollywood blockbusters will add blurriness and shake for dramatic effect. Some action sequences have been shot entirely on handheld cameras for this reason. But to pull off this technique successfully, you need to have extremely steady hands. If you don’t have the steadiest hands, you can always use a good tripod instead.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Eliminating <strong>camera shake</strong> and gaining better control over it are lessons that almost every photographer learns early on. Yet there is still a large amount of misunderstanding about how it works. The vast majority of people don’t truly understand what causes the camera to shake or how they can control it within their shooting style to get the sharpest possible images. Whether you are a beginning or advanced amateur photographer or videographer, knowing how to exert pressure when handling your camera gear properly is key to obtaining images that show fewer signs of blur from camera shake.</p><p>As we’ve seen, there are things you can do to ensure that your photos and videos are as steady as possible. Going into any shoot with an awareness of camera shake will help you avoid accidents, but the reality is that these accidents do happen. Even if you have an extremely steady hand, your camera may not be capable of capturing the blur-free photos or videos that you’re looking for.</p><p>That’s why awareness can go a long way towards helping you catch potential problems and solve them before they become actual problems. Of course, once you notice a lack of stability in your photos, it can be easier said than done to address the issue. There are various tools out there to help smooth out shaky footage after it has been captured, but getting that footage off your camera in one piece will be the first step in being able to use those tools effectively.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>When taking photographs or filming videos, there are a lot of elements to worry about.

Is the lighting correct? Is the focus autofocus or manual? Is the background distracting from the subject? But there’s another thing you should be thinking about: camera shake. If you’ve ever looked at pictures online and thought they’re blurred - that’s probably because of camera shake. This isn’t always easy to get rid of post-production if you’ve filmed on a DSLR camera, so it’s better to get it right in camera. A few different things cause a camera shake, so here we’ll take a look at what causes this and how you can stop it from happening when taking your next photograph.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-1.jpg"                      alt="camera shake effect"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article-2"><a href="#In-this-article-2" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">The Definition of Camera Shake</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Is Camera Shake A Bad Thing?</a></p><h2 id="The-Definition-of-Camera-Shake-2"><a href="#The-Definition-of-Camera-Shake-2" class="headerlink" title="The Definition of Camera Shake"></a>The Definition of Camera Shake</h2><p>Camera shake is the camera’s movement during the exposure of a photograph. This can be caused by either a badly mounted camera or because the shutter speed was too slow for the lens’s focal length. Camera shake is most noticeable when you shoot at telephoto focal lengths and at high magnifications (zoomed in) with a long exposure time.</p><h3 id="In-Pictures-4"><a href="#In-Pictures-4" class="headerlink" title="In Pictures"></a>In Pictures</h3><p>Anyone who takes pictures seriously will eventually face the problem of camera shake. This happens when the camera shakes during exposure due to the photographer pushing the shutter button or a shaky hand. This can result in blurry photos, but there are several ways to avoid it in most situations. Camera shake is one of the most common problems photographers and videographers face and is one of the easiest to fix.</p><h3 id="In-Videos-4"><a href="#In-Videos-4" class="headerlink" title="In Videos"></a>In Videos</h3><p>Videos are made up of individual frames, each capturing one moment in time. When your video contains a scene that moves from left to right, the frames that make up that scene move from left to right as well. If there’s any movement in the frame except for horizontal movements, such as vertical movement caused by camera shake, you’ll see it in every frame of your video.</p><h2 id="Is-Camera-Shake-A-Bad-Thing-2"><a href="#Is-Camera-Shake-A-Bad-Thing-2" class="headerlink" title="Is Camera Shake A Bad Thing?"></a>Is Camera Shake A Bad Thing?</h2><p>So, is camera shake a bad thing? Yes, most of the time, but there are times when you can actually use it to your advantage. For example, in a long exposure shot, you may want to introduce some camera shake on purpose to blur moving objects and create a creative effect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-2.jpg"                      alt="is camera shake a bad thing"                ></p><p>Another example where a camera shake can work in your favour is handheld macro photography. When shooting handheld macro shots, the motion of your hands can help keep the lens aligned with an object in front of you—if you move too slowly, the lens might lose alignment with what you’re shooting.</p><p>So if you find yourself facing a situation where you don’t have a tripod or monopod handy, and you need steady shots, try using different techniques like bracing your body against solid objects or using burst mode to capture multiple images and choosing the sharpest one from the bunch.</p><h3 id="In-Pictures-5"><a href="#In-Pictures-5" class="headerlink" title="In Pictures"></a>In Pictures</h3><p>A camera shake is a big problem for most photographers. It’s the enemy of sharp images, and when you’re shooting with a telephoto lens, even the smallest amount of camera shake can cause blurry images.</p><p>A camera shake is generally a bad thing when you’re shooting still photography. It can cause your images to be blurry (and therefore unusable), and the more you zoom in, the more pronounced that effect is.</p><p>If you’re shooting with a tripod, you’ll know if you have a camera shake if the image looks blurry. If it does, don’t worry — there are ways to fix it in post-processing.

Virtual-reality actually has an extensive history with a concept that dates all the way back to the 1930s. In this article we will discuss the history of VR and how it has evolved since an early concept into the amazing simulation experience that you can have in your home today.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/history-of-vr.bmp"                      alt="history-of-vr"                ></p><p> <strong><em>You may also like:</em></strong><br><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >What is virtual reality and how does it work? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em><br><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 professional 360 degree cameras <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em><br><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Virtual Reality Technology: Current State and Future Challenges <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><h2 id="VR-development-in-1930s"><a href="#VR-development-in-1930s" class="headerlink" title="VR development in 1930s"></a>VR development in 1930s</h2><p>In Pygmalions Spectacles, Stanley G. Weinbaum explains a goggle based game in which individuals can watch a holographic recording of virtual stories including touch and smell. This amazing vision of the future would actually turn into what we think of as virtual-reality today. While it’s difficult to introduce touch and smell elements into the average virtual-reality experience, these are visions that creators have in mind for the very near future of virtual-reality experiences. It’s amazing to think that 85+ years ago, people were already thinking about creating simulation experiences using technology. We still think of these types of plans as we look towards the future of VR. With rapidly changing technology however, these improvements to the VR simulation experience may be far closer than decades away.</p><h2 id="VR-development-in-1960s"><a href="#VR-development-in-1960s" class="headerlink" title="VR development in 1960s"></a>VR development in 1960s</h2><p>VR headsets actually started development in the 1960s. Just 30 years from the original thought of a VR headset, Ivann Sutherland created the very first VR headset for use with military applications. Using a specialized military software as well as a motion control platform, the first VR headsets were designed for use in training exercises. These VR training tools have now become the standard in the military for training for flight exercises, combat situations and more. An immersive experience is definitely required to push military personnel and prepare them in a safe training environment before they enter into the field. Many air forces around the world require an extensive amount of VR training simulations before they will even let a pilot into one of their aircraft. With the initial development using specialized software and motion controls, VR research would continue to pave the way for training in the military and beyond. Today’s military VR headsets are far more advanced, compact and immersive and these training programs as well as the technology will continue to develop a little bit faster than some of the products that we might find as regular consumers.</p><h2 id="VR-development-in-1990s"><a href="#VR-development-in-1990s" class="headerlink" title="VR development in 1990s"></a>VR development in 1990s</h2><p>VR headsets begin to make their way into a few arcade games for simulations and Nintendo announced the first home VR system. Virtual Boy was one of the first home systems available for use with a widespread appeal. Sega also introduced a Sega VR headset for the Sega Genesis console in the year 1993. These wraparound prototypes had stereo sound, LCD screens and head tracking. Technical development in this VR headset doom the project and the cost of the headset was extensive making it a massive flop for Sega. The Virtual Boy however was a 3-D game console that experienced a little more success. Virtual Boy was released in North America at a price of $180. The games were entirely made in red and black and there were only a few pieces of software available with the device. Users would wear a VR headset and control the action on a regular Nintendo controller. Unfortunately the console was very uncomfortable to use and because of the lack of games as well as the lack of color, it didn’t present the same strong sales as the other Nintendo consoles out at the time.</p><h2 id="VR-development-in-2014"><a href="#VR-development-in-2014" class="headerlink" title="VR development in 2014"></a>VR development in 2014</h2><p>Oculus VR represents the latest revolution in VR technology. When Facebook officially acquired the Oculus VR system, this showed that virtual-reality was becoming a huge concern for many of the world’s top developers. Although the Oculus Rift was formed out of a kickstarter campaign in 2012, the deal in 2014 represented a huge boost in their funding and confidence. Later in 2015, Oculus began to acquire other companies like Surreal Vision and built partnerships with Samsung to develop the Samsung gear VR. As one of the leading companies in VR development, Oculus has fully functioning VR systems for consumers to purchase and use at home. With support for a wide range of applications and further applications being developed for specific use with their VR systems, this was a huge leap forward for VR. After gaining international attention with the demand after the Facebook deal, this would propel many other developers into creating their own VR development firms. Oculus in a way started a brand-new VR renaissance with a call to create immersive and simulated experiences for the average consumer. Previous VR headsets were very technical and inaccessible for the average computer user, but with plug-and-play compatibility and a wide host of supported applications, Oculus gave the average consumer hope that they can enjoy VR again.</p><h2 id="VR-development-in-2016-and-beyond"><a href="#VR-development-in-2016-and-beyond" class="headerlink" title="VR development in 2016 and beyond"></a>VR development in 2016 and beyond</h2><p>With the initial surge after Oculus Rift, companies all over the world began building their own VR headsets and producing some fantastic new tech. With so many new devices coming out from many of the world’s top manufacturers, we are seeing huge developments when it comes to apps, 360° cameras, inexpensive headsets, VR glass experiences and more. As 3-D graphics continue to get better and is processing power lines at an exponential rate, VR is becoming a focus for many developers in the future. There are many consumer products coming out to compete with Oculus based off its demand as well as generic products for use with smart phone technology. As many smart phones have the accelerometer data, advanced soundcards and graphic sets for 3d rendering users are opting to watch 360 videos and try virtual-reality apps with their smartphone and home devices like Google Cardboard. Other users however are holding out for products like the Oculus Rift, Playstation VR and more. With all of these devices set to drop in mass circulation by the end of 2016 or the start of 2017 we are truly going to start seeing at home VR experiences which are widespread.</p><p>The future of VR looks very bright and with so many new devices in development is a trend that’s not going away anytime soon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/understanding-and-leveraging-snapchat-spotlight/"><u>Understanding and Leveraging Snapchat Spotlight</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/in-2024-no-more-quick-yt-thumbnails-full-length-viewing/"><u>In 2024, No More Quick YT Thumbnails  Full-Length Viewing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-exploring-the-spectrum-projectors-and-televisions-in-a-4k-world/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Exploring the Spectrum  Projectors & Televisions in a 4K World</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/10-best-photo-grid-apps-to-make-your-pictures-stand-out/"><u>10 Best Photo Grid Apps to Make Your Pictures Stand Out</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mastering-windows-11-movie-maker-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mastering Windows 11 Movie Maker  A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/high-quality-cameras-ideal-for-podcasts/"><u>High-Quality Cameras Ideal for Podcasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/best-action-cameras-unlocked-your-2023-snorkeling-guide-for-2024/"><u>Best Action Cameras Unlocked - Your 2023 Snorkeling Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/2024-approved-from-srt-to-the-future-mastering-xmlssattml-transforms/"><u>2024 Approved  From SRT to the Future  Mastering XML/SSA/TTML Transforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/unleashing-brand-potential-with-essential-phrases-for-2024/"><u>Unleashing Brand Potential with Essential Phrases for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-behind-the-scenes-how-to-master-voice-manipulation-with-free-tools/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Behind the Scenes  How to Master Voice Manipulation with Free Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-androidprocessmedia-has-stopped-on-xiaomi-mix-fold-3-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Fix Android.Process.Media Has Stopped on Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-effective-ways-to-fix-checkra1n-error-31-from-iphone-15-pro-max-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Effective Ways To Fix Checkra1n Error 31 From iPhone 15 Pro Max</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mastering-live-game-replays-with-fraps/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mastering Live Game Replays with Fraps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/can-life360-track-you-when-your-nubia-red-magic-9-proplus-is-off-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Can Life360 Track You When Your Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ is off?

A little over 50% of those users don’t have Spotify premium. This means they will be exposed to ads. So, you have a potential audience of over 200 million people.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://headphonesaddict.com/listening-to-music-statistics/" >23% of all recorded users <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> use a streaming service like Spotify to listen to music.

The most common devices used are a car’s radio and smartphones.</p><p>Additionally, Spotify’s ads system is quite effective. Most of their free-plan users expect to hear ads. Therefore, they are prepared and will listen through the entire ad while focusing on the message.</p><p>These are more than enough reasons to understand the potential of Spotify ads.</p><p>Also, did you know that you can create several ads on Spotify that differ significantly? Yes, there are four significant types of Spotify ads.</p><h2 id="4-Main-Types-of-Spotify-Ads-How-to-Choose-the-Best-One"><a href="#4-Main-Types-of-Spotify-Ads-How-to-Choose-the-Best-One" class="headerlink" title="4 Main Types of Spotify Ads (How to Choose the Best One)"></a>4 Main Types of Spotify Ads (How to Choose the Best One)</h2><p>We already discussed the incredible potential and exposure ads on Spotify can bring. Now, it’s time to find out what type of ad will be ideal in your case.</p><h3 id="Audio-Ads"><a href="#Audio-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Audio Ads"></a>Audio Ads</h3><p>Any guide to Spotify ads will tell you that their audio ads are the easiest to create. Anyone can make them. You must record a 15-30 second audio clip sharing your message.</p><p>Spotify’s Ad Studio offers fantastic tools to help you create your ads. You may also place a creative image on the ad with a link straight to your landing page, website, or offer.</p><p>The idea is to make this a straightforward process that makes the listener want to click.</p><p>Spotify is accurate at predicting when the user is most receptive. That’s when it will play your audio ad.</p><h3 id="Spotify-Video-Ads"><a href="#Spotify-Video-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Spotify Video Ads"></a>Spotify Video Ads</h3><p>Video ads on Spotify are 15 to 30-second clips that include audio and visuals to convey a message. They can be played on both Desktop and Mobile.</p><p>Spotify will display these ads when the user is actively engaged on the screen. However, it will not play them if their phone is locked and if Spotify is not active on the net.</p><p>There are two types of Spotify video ads you can use, namely video Takeover Ads and Spotify Sponsored Sessions. Choosing the one that’s right for you can significantly increase conversions.</p><p><strong>Takeover ads</strong> pop up when you’re actively going through Spotify and its music catalogues. <strong>Sponsored Sessions</strong> are video ads that let you watch them in exchange for 30 minutes of ad-free music.</p><p>Compared to Spotify audio ads, video ads offer a few advantages:</p><ul><li>Video ads play unmuted and allow for a more visual presentation of what is being advertised</li><li>They can be displayed when users are actively using the app</li><li>Each video ad can grant you the chance to use Spotify ad-free for 30 minutes per ad watched</li></ul><h3 id="Overlay-Ads-Display-Ads"><a href="#Overlay-Ads-Display-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Overlay Ads (Display Ads)"></a>Overlay Ads (Display Ads)</h3><p>These ads do not have audio or video in them at all. They include an image that showcases what you are offering. They can be cheaper than other types of Spotify ads as well.</p><p>Usually, an overlay ad will be displayed at the top of the Spotify app. Whenever the user goes back to the Spotify interface, that’s when these ads will be displayed. Users can click on them and be led to wherever your landing destination is set online.</p><h3 id="Sponsored-List"><a href="#Sponsored-List" class="headerlink" title="Sponsored List"></a>Sponsored List</h3><p>Also known as Spotify Sponsored Playlists, they allow you to launch a brand awareness campaign on Spotify. You may create playlists of songs that best relate to your brand. You can also include visuals and graphics that clearly promote your brand.</p><p>Additionally, users will be shown more of your ads whenever they pause the playlist you are sponsoring.</p><h2 id="Successful-Examples-of-Spotify-Ads"><a href="#Successful-Examples-of-Spotify-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Successful Examples of Spotify Ads"></a>Successful Examples of Spotify Ads</h2><p>After introducing the types of Spotify ads, to help you have a deeper understanding of it, we have chosen two successful examples of Spotify ads for you.

You may also place a creative image on the ad with a link straight to your landing page, website, or offer.</p><p>The idea is to make this a straightforward process that makes the listener want to click.</p><p>Spotify is accurate at predicting when the user is most receptive. That’s when it will play your audio ad.</p><h3 id="Spotify-Video-Ads-1"><a href="#Spotify-Video-Ads-1" class="headerlink" title="Spotify Video Ads"></a>Spotify Video Ads</h3><p>Video ads on Spotify are 15 to 30-second clips that include audio and visuals to convey a message. They can be played on both Desktop and Mobile.</p><p>Spotify will display these ads when the user is actively engaged on the screen. However, it will not play them if their phone is locked and if Spotify is not active on the net.</p><p>There are two types of Spotify video ads you can use, namely video Takeover Ads and Spotify Sponsored Sessions. Choosing the one that’s right for you can significantly increase conversions.</p><p><strong>Takeover ads</strong> pop up when you’re actively going through Spotify and its music catalogues. <strong>Sponsored Sessions</strong> are video ads that let you watch them in exchange for 30 minutes of ad-free music.</p><p>Compared to Spotify audio ads, video ads offer a few advantages:</p><ul><li>Video ads play unmuted and allow for a more visual presentation of what is being advertised</li><li>They can be displayed when users are actively using the app</li><li>Each video ad can grant you the chance to use Spotify ad-free for 30 minutes per ad watched</li></ul><h3 id="Overlay-Ads-Display-Ads-1"><a href="#Overlay-Ads-Display-Ads-1" class="headerlink" title="Overlay Ads (Display Ads)"></a>Overlay Ads (Display Ads)</h3><p>These ads do not have audio or video in them at all. They include an image that showcases what you are offering. They can be cheaper than other types of Spotify ads as well.</p><p>Usually, an overlay ad will be displayed at the top of the Spotify app. Whenever the user goes back to the Spotify interface, that’s when these ads will be displayed. Users can click on them and be led to wherever your landing destination is set online.</p><h3 id="Sponsored-List-1"><a href="#Sponsored-List-1" class="headerlink" title="Sponsored List"></a>Sponsored List</h3><p>Also known as Spotify Sponsored Playlists, they allow you to launch a brand awareness campaign on Spotify. You may create playlists of songs that best relate to your brand. You can also include visuals and graphics that clearly promote your brand.</p><p>Additionally, users will be shown more of your ads whenever they pause the playlist you are sponsoring.</p><h2 id="Successful-Examples-of-Spotify-Ads-1"><a href="#Successful-Examples-of-Spotify-Ads-1" class="headerlink" title="Successful Examples of Spotify Ads"></a>Successful Examples of Spotify Ads</h2><p>After introducing the types of Spotify ads, to help you have a deeper understanding of it, we have chosen two successful examples of Spotify ads for you.

The resources utilized to express a story and convey a message include films, photography, animation, and music. These stories may distribute more widely and swiftly than ever through online platforms like webpages, journals, and social media sharing sites.</p><p><strong><em>“Simply put, it is telling stories with digital technologies.

A rising number of businesses are taking note and investigating the potential applications of a digital story.

Development of Digital Storytelling"></a>Part II. Development of Digital Storytelling</h2><p>Dana Atchley and Joe Lambert of the Center for Digital Storytelling started the digital storytelling advancement in 1994 by teaching others how to create digital stories. Although the power of storytelling has existed for thousands of years, it has only recently become possible for storytellers to <strong>“become digital”</strong> because of the advancement of personal computers and friendly modern communications.</p><p>High goals and outdated technologies coexisted throughout this period. Browsers were quite straightforward at the time, and dial-up remained still in use. There were no devices for accessing the internet, and most individuals read the digital narrative on their desktop computers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/tools-and-tips-virtual-storytelling-2.jpg"                      alt="tools and tips for virtual storytelling"                ></p><p>In this regard, the Center for Digital Storytelling developed a digital story that emphasized first-person narratives that framed memories as potent stories using visuals, audio, and music. The capacity to add graphics and narration to stories gives them a unique significance for both the author and the audience of virtual storytelling.</p><h3 id="Power-of-Digital-Storytelling-Compared-to-Traditional-Storytelling"><a href="#Power-of-Digital-Storytelling-Compared-to-Traditional-Storytelling" class="headerlink" title="Power of Digital Storytelling Compared to Traditional Storytelling"></a>Power of Digital Storytelling Compared to Traditional Storytelling</h3><p>Compared to traditional storytelling, digital storytelling is far more integrative and incorporates non-linguistic factors that give rise to new narratives. Images, visual effects, and soundtracks are not merely additions to the story; they are crucial and inseparable components. As a result, digital storytelling demands variety, multisensory stimulation, and a variety of media channels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/online-modern-storytelling-view-3.jpg"                      alt="online view of modern storytelling"                ></p><p>While oral and written stories in traditional storytelling will only focus on listening and reading abilities, digital storytelling will emphasize other skills like interaction by encouraging knowledge acquisition and technology literacy by interacting with technological sources, thus possessing the power of storytelling.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> Visit <a href="https://youtu.be/eryg29f294U"><strong>Wondershare Filmora9: Discover the Power of Storytelling</strong></a> if you’re interested in learning how to create a digital storytelling video example.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Practices-of-Digital-Storytelling"><a href="#Part-III-Practices-of-Digital-Storytelling" class="headerlink" title="Part III.

The chalky gray notebook features a 2.6 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7-6700HQ processor that is accompanied by Nvidia GeForce GTX 950M and Intel HD Graphics 530 graphics cards.
