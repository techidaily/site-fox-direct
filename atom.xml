Surely, playing PUBG on your mobile is fun and it is also more simple, but there is a limit that you can’t do on your mobile. When you are gaming, the flexibility of the keyboard and mouse are the best things ever. Then, can you play PUBG mobile on your PC or laptop?</p><p>In this part, I will let you know how you play PUBG on a PC and how to connect with a PC voice changer. Tencent just launched its official PUBG Mobile emulator which enables you to play it even on a PC or a laptop. For those who want to have flexibility without limitation, you better watch the steps on how you play PUBG mobile on your PC below:</p><p>Step1 Download and install the Tencent Gaming Buddy emulator</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-6.jpg"                      alt="click download"                ></p><p>Download Tencent Buddy Emulator, then run the software and it will download the required files automatically. It takes about 10-15 minutes to install it.</p><p>Step2 Download the additional files</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-7.jpg"                      alt="download additional files"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151870/7443" target="_top" id="2151870">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151870" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151870/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>When the emulator is installed, launch the game. It will download some necessary files required to launch the game. Make sure you have good internet connectivity since these files are large.</p><p>Step3 Get your chicken dinner</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-8.jpg"                      alt="you are done"                ></p><p>When finish downloading all the additional files, log in with your credentials to import all your mobile PUBG stats. All the controls are in a tab towards the right side of the screen, enter full-screen mode by pressing F11. Since PUBG servers detect emulators, you and your friends will only be paired with other players running this emulator.</p><p>Then, you may ask, “How do I connect with a PC voice changer?” No worries, I will let you know too. For your information, free voice changers are much easier to find on PC. There are some good voice changers for PUBG such as Clownfish, Voicemod, and MorphVOX. I will give you the steps to connect with Clownfish in PUBG:</p><p>Step1 Download and launch Clownfish</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-9.jpg"                      alt="set voice changer"                ></p><p>Download the software, then launch it. After that select “Set Voice Changer” and select any desired sound effects.</p><p>Step2 Click on “Hear Microphone”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-10.jpg"                      alt="hear the voice effects"                ></p><p>Click on “Hear Microphone” and hear the voice effects. Turn that off when you have chosen your favorite effect and you are done.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983475">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983475.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983475">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983475.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983475%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983475/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Method-3-Buy-a-hardware-voice-changer-to-connect-your-phone"><a href="#Part-3-Method-3-Buy-a-hardware-voice-changer-to-connect-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Method 3: Buy a hardware voice changer to connect your phone"></a>Part 3: Method 3: Buy a hardware voice changer to connect your phone</h2><p>After you know the voice changer on your phone and your PC for PUBG, what is another alternative you can do to change your voice in PUBG? Well, eventually you can also use a hardware voice changer and connect it to your phone. When you use hardware, the result should be in real-time, which is less than a 30ms delay, while it takes a longer delay when you use the software.</p><p>There are some hardware voice changers out there. For the hardware, I recommend you try TC Helicon VoiceLive Play. The TC Helicon VoiceLive Play is such a great vocal effects unit. It is simple, has a user-friendly layout, and has a small footprint. Around the LCD Display, there are six buttons. They are labeled and work dependent on context when you’re in the menus on the VoiceLive Play.</p><p>Their base functions are Genre, Setup, Effects, Favorite, Practice, and Mix (to adjust the output levels, USB input level, and the level for the in-built mic). These controls have context-dependent functions. To navigate the menus and adjust selected parameters, just simply use the left-right arrow buttons and the control dial below. There are also Back and Store buttons on either side of these. You use these to step back a menu level and save any changes that you’ve made.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-11.jpg"                      alt="voicelive play"                ></p><p>Compared to the VoiceLive 3 and the VoiceLive 3 Extreme’s menus, the 32-page guide to the VoiceLive Play tells you that the pedal is so simple to get to grips with. The menu system and layout of the VoiceLive Play make it easy to access any features that you want. There is a feature that will give you the tools you need to produce pretty much any vocal effect you want.</p><p>The effects groups include harmonies, reverbs, delays, transducers HardTune, doubling, harmony effects, and μmod, which is TC Helicon’s name for chorus, flangers, and similar effects. The sounds are generally good, too. For the price, the TC Helicon VoiceLive costs $ 279. Overall, once you finish setting up gotten your sounds, it’s really easy to incorporate the VoiceLive and you can have a hardware voice changer for PUBG.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-edit-the-voice-in-a-video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-edit-the-voice-in-a-video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to edit the voice in a video with Filmora?"></a>Part 4: How to edit the voice in a video with Filmora?</h2><p>Besides those mentioned above, do you know that you can also edit the video with Filmora?

It sets the tone of the entire presentation and helps create a lasting impact on audiences. Not giving any priority to music can be a common mistake for marketers who naturally place more importance on content. Sometimes, these mistakes can cause time constraints and even cost money. Here’s how you can find the right <strong>paid and free trailer music</strong> for your ventures.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/trailer-music-1.jpg"                      alt="trailer music"                ></p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">SoundCloud</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">ccMixter</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">Free Music Archive</a></li><li><a href="#part2-4">FreePD</a></li><li><a href="#part2-5">Uppbeat</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">How to add music to your trailer</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-choose-the-background-music-for-the-trailer"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-choose-the-background-music-for-the-trailer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

This means that things like up and down and lilts in the sound can affect different kinds of emotions in your video.</p><p>Because of that, you must time your video content according to those factors. Maximize the emotional impact in your videos by perfectly timing your content and matching the music’s pace.

Consider these goals and use them as a guide while selecting the music.</p><p>It is recommended to avoid relying on simple tags like “trailer music” or “trailer background songs”, as these usually show generic results that do not factor in tone and setting.

Take advantage of tags and keywords to find a song that works best for you.</p><h3 id="Test-With-Watermarked-Tracks-1"><a href="#Test-With-Watermarked-Tracks-1" class="headerlink" title="Test With Watermarked Tracks"></a><strong>Test With Watermarked Tracks</strong></h3><p>Many websites may require you to pay for tracks before you can test them out in your video.

With these tracks, you can test the files on your video editor so you can check for tone and timing without spending unnecessarily.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Free-Websites-for-Downloading-Trailer-Music-1"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Free-Websites-for-Downloading-Trailer-Music-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Thankfully there are certain GoPro settings which can be tweaked to maximize the GoPro battery life and in this article we are going to discuss a few easy ways of improving your GoPro battery life. On an average the battery of your GoPro would last just for about 1 ½ hours or even less while shooting in 4K with the LCD screen on and Wi-Fi connected.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Batteries and Chargers for GoPro Hero5 &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Improve-GoPro’s-Battery-life"><a href="#How-to-Improve-GoPro’s-Battery-life" class="headerlink" title="How to Improve GoPro’s Battery life"></a>How to Improve GoPro’s Battery life</h2><h4 id="1-Update-the-firmware"><a href="#1-Update-the-firmware" class="headerlink" title="1. Update the firmware"></a>1. Update the firmware</h4><p> Are you still not taking the firmware updates of your camera seriously? Though most action camera shooters do not have the time to ponder over all those tech stuff, yet you need to keep your camera’s firmware updated if you are looking forward to conserving your battery. There is always a possibility that your GoPro firmware isn’t actually updated. Doing this would not just fix any recurrent problems which you might be having with your camera but it would also improve the battery life immensely because of any fixes implemented by the company. The GoPro firmware can be updated by connecting the cam to a smartphone over Wi-Fi and then by updating it with the help of the GoPro app. In case you are using an older model you have to download the firmware which is available on the GoPro website and then transfer it to your GoPro SD card and run the update from your cam.</p><h4 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M14ATO0/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01M14ATO0&linkId=5ce54ea937ecffa6b1b8056b6922abaa" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>2. Keep the cam turned off when not in use</p><p> This sounds pretty obvious doesn’t it? When you turn on your camera but not recording anything then the battery gets drains slowly. So make sure to keep your GoPro switched off whenever you are not shooting so as to save the battery. The Quick Capture is an useful feature which allows the cam to start recording instantly whenever it is powered on.</p><h4 id="3-Use-the-“Auto-Power-Off-Setting”"><a href="#3-Use-the-“Auto-Power-Off-Setting”" class="headerlink" title="3. Use the “Auto Power Off Setting”"></a>3. Use the “Auto Power Off Setting”</h4><p> Many of us forget to switch on our cameras after shooting and this slowly depletes the camera’s battery. If you are one of those people who always forget to turn off the camera only to find a low battery indication after some time then what you need to do is turn on the ‘Auto Power Off Setting’. All you have to do is go to the settings menu and then click on the button 13 times till you have the option to select the number of seconds you would like to give your cam till it shuts down automatically. You can choose from 60, 120, and 300 seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gopro-auto-power-off-setting.jpg"                      alt="Save GoPro battery life"                ></p><h4 id="4-Turn-off-the-red-indicator-and-beeping-lights"><a href="#4-Turn-off-the-red-indicator-and-beeping-lights" class="headerlink" title="4. Turn off the red indicator and beeping lights"></a>4. Turn off the red indicator and beeping lights</h4><p> The red light which constantly blinks while shooting a footage is not just a major distraction to the viewer but also a cause of battery drainage. This red indicator light is meant for letting the user know when the cam is recording. However professional cinematographers will easily learn that as long as the record button is pressed properly the GoPro is going to start shooting no matter if the red light is blinking or not. Though the light indicator doesn’t have that much of an impact on the overall battery life but when it comes to battery life improvement every little thing helps.</p><h4 id="5-Turn-off-the-Wi-Fi-and-Bluetooth"><a href="#5-Turn-off-the-Wi-Fi-and-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="5. Turn off the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth"></a>5. Turn off the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth</h4><p> Just like any other devices, turning off the WIFI and Bluetooth in your GoPro cam can greatly help to enhance the battery life. Turning of these 2 could extend your battery life by about 10-15 minutes. Make sure not to accidentally press the WIFI button at the side of your camera while shooting.</p><h4 id="6-Give-up-the-Remote-and-the-smartphone-app"><a href="#6-Give-up-the-Remote-and-the-smartphone-app" class="headerlink" title="6. Give up the Remote and the smartphone app"></a>6. Give up the Remote and the smartphone app</h4><p> The remote control of your GoPro is not just difficult to use but also takes a toll on the battery life of the camera. It could lower the overall battery life of your cam by about 15%-20% depending on the usage. Try using a selfie stick instead of the remote. Avoid pairing your cam with your phone since it’s more of a wastage of your time and the camera battery. So leave the remote behind and stop playing with your smartphone so as to shoot a lot more footage with your GoPro.</p><h4 id="7-Reduce-the-frame-rate-or-the-recording-resolution"><a href="#7-Reduce-the-frame-rate-or-the-recording-resolution" class="headerlink" title="7. Reduce the frame rate or the recording resolution"></a>7. Reduce the frame rate or the recording resolution</h4><p> Always keep in mind that the less the number of pixels and frames your camera is recording the less battery it uses. Try to have the video setting of your GoPro set to 1080p but for a special reason to shoot in ultra HD. Also make sure to turn off the Protune feature in your camera. The 1080p at 60 fps is the norm for shooting any GoPro footage. However you can always reduce it to 720p or leave it at 1080p only with 30 frames per sec instead of 60 unless you are shooting a professional video with the best possible res. If you are just shooting for fun then 720p is surely going to work great and more importantly it would give you more footage in the end.</p><h4 id="8-Keep-the-LCD-screen-turned-off"><a href="#8-Keep-the-LCD-screen-turned-off" class="headerlink" title="8. Keep the LCD screen turned off"></a>8. Keep the LCD screen turned off</h4><p> The LCD screens in the new GroPro are a superb feature which not only allows you to see whatever you are recording but also change the setting more conveniently. However the LCD screen can substantially drain the battery so when you want to capture more footage its best for you to turn off the LCD and shoot in the old school way.</p><h4 id="9-Get-extra-batteries-or-an-extended-battery-pack"><a href="#9-Get-extra-batteries-or-an-extended-battery-pack" class="headerlink" title="9. Get extra batteries or an extended battery pack"></a>9. Get extra batteries or an extended battery pack</h4><p> Surely this is one of the easiest ways of getting the most out of your GoPro camera. You can just buy a few spare batteries from the 3rd party vendors at a very affordable price so that you don’t have to worry about shooting to your heart’s content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-elevating-your-unbox-sessions-secrets-for-more-views-and-likes-on-tiktok/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Elevating Your Unbox Sessions Secrets for More Views and Likes on TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-sj7s-latest-4k-star-cam-a-revolutionary-action-recorder/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved SJ7's Latest 4K Star Cam - A Revolutionary Action Recorder</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-navigating-networking-on-linkedin-for-2024/"><u>[New] Navigating Networking on LinkedIn for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-vlogging-battle-gopro-hero5-black-vs-sessions/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Vlogging Battle GoPro Hero5 Black VS Sessions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-elevate-your-content-selecting-the-best-video-aspect-ratio/"><u>[Updated] Elevate Your Content Selecting the Best Video Aspect Ratio</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-full-dynamics-review-2023/"><u>[Updated] Full Dynamics Review 2023</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-innovative-techniques-for-capturing-audio-on-ipad-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Innovative Techniques for Capturing Audio on iPad for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-professional-gimbals-and-tripods-for-youtube-starters-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Professional Gimbals & Tripods for YouTube Starters for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-seamless-transition-adopting-windows-11/"><u>[Updated] Seamless Transition Adopting Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-trailblazing-the-future-of-3d-color-grading-tools/"><u>[Updated] Trailblazing the Future of 3D Color Grading Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/nba-2k21-pc-stability-issues-resolved-no-more-game-crashes/"><u>NBA 2K21 PC Stability Issues Resolved - No More Game Crashes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/streaming-mastery-ioss-no1-freepluspaid-movie-apps-guide/"><u>Streaming Mastery IOS's No.1, FREE+Paid Movie Apps Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-guide-how-to-fix-an-unresponsive-meizu-21-screen-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Troubleshooting Guide How to Fix an Unresponsive Meizu 21 Screen | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983582">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983582.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983582">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983582.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983582%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983582/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

How to create a meme with Imgur online?"></a>Part 1. How to create a meme with Imgur online?</h2><p>Often the meme creators are required to generate memes instantaneously with a new trend and in such situations, installing a meme generator on the device and then editing and creating a meme is very ineffective. To solve this issue, you can use the Imgur meme maker which is an online platform that lets users create memes on the go.

And if you want to edit your meme and post it on any social media, then Imgur is the best choice.

The quality and size of the pictures today are better than ever before, and the possibility to enjoy near perfect image quality from the comfort of your own home has never been more accessible to the mainstream audience. Still, there is one important question that remains unanswered. Does a projector provide a better 4K experience than the 4K TV? Most people who face the projector VS TV dilemma are just looking for the best home entertainment experience, so here are some information that can help you make your own choice.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="4K-Projectors-Vs-4K-TVs"><a href="#4K-Projectors-Vs-4K-TVs" class="headerlink" title="4K Projectors Vs 4K TVs"></a>4K Projectors Vs 4K TVs</h2><h4 id="1-Resolution"><a href="#1-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="1.  Resolution"></a>1.  Resolution</h4><p> When you are buying a 4K TV there is very little doubt whether or not it is indeed a 4K TV. If the screen resolution is 3840 X 2160 then you are looking at the 4K Ultra HD TV, anything short of that is no longer a 4K TV. With TVs that have a resolution as high as this, you can be sure that all 4K or HDR content is designed to fit perfectly on its screen, while things are a little bit different with 4K projectors.</p><p> Many of the 4K projectors are not exactly that because they offer a pseudo 4K resolution through pixel interpolation. To make things even worse, most of the projectors offer only the ability to read and display 4K content, through native Full HD image sensor. If you are not looking to buy a high-end 4K projector make sure that the item you wish to purchase has a true 4K capability.</p><h4 id="2-Brightness-and-Contrast"><a href="#2-Brightness-and-Contrast" class="headerlink" title="2.  Brightness and Contrast"></a>2.  Brightness and Contrast</h4><p> If you ever watched a movie in a cinema you know that projectors need dark rooms to deliver their best performance. The image brightness, 4K projectors designed for home entertainment, can deliver is largely dependent on the light conditions of the room. But even in the perfect conditions of a darkened room, most projectors can’t generate the same level of the projection brightness as a 4K TV.</p><p> On the other hand, most projectors have overall better contrast ratios than the one generated on the screen of a 4K HDR TV, with the exception of TVs that feature OLED technology.</p><h4 id="3-Colors"><a href="#3-Colors" class="headerlink" title="3.  Colors"></a>3.  Colors</h4><p> Projector vs 4K TV dilemma becomes slightly more complicated when it comes to colors since both 4K TVs and 4K HDR projectors deliver stunningly vibrant colors. In addition, both of these device types are capable of displaying 90% of the HDR color space and cover more than 1.07 billion color shades.</p><p> Even though the colors look more vivid on 4K TVs solely because of its huge brightness advantage over the projectors, 4K HDR projectors still offer a somewhat wider color space and coverage.</p><h4 id="4-Picture-Display"><a href="#4-Picture-Display" class="headerlink" title="4.  Picture Display"></a>4.  Picture Display</h4><p> There is no question that projectors have a clear advantage over TVs when it comes to picture display. You can adjust the size of the picture by changing the projector’s distance from the surface you want to project the pictures to and you can choose on which surface you want to project pictures. Projection screens usually do the trick, although there might be some research involved related to the room characteristics since you need to know the dimensions of the wall and the room size so you can place the projector at the optimum distance from the screen.</p><p> With 4K TVs, you may not get a huge picture display, but the conditions you have to meet in order to enjoy 4K images are much simpler.</p><h4 id="5-Audio"><a href="#5-Audio" class="headerlink" title="5.  Audio"></a>5.  Audio</h4><p> All 4K TVs have their own speakers that are more than enough to enjoy the 4K footage you want to watch on your TV. Some models of 4K projectors can have speakers, but because of the position of the projector, they are often behind and above you which doesn’t bode well for the audio performance. Most 4K projectors require a setup that includes several external speakers to enable an enjoyable viewing experience.</p><p> Furthermore, 4K TV’s are much easier to connect with audio devices and you can control the setup with the TV’s remote which makes your home entertainment experience much more comfortable.</p><h4 id="6-Installation"><a href="#6-Installation" class="headerlink" title="6.  Installation"></a>6.  Installation</h4><p> Setting up a 4K TV is very simple. All you need to do is to find an elevated flat surface on which you wish to place the TV, plug it into the nearest electrical socket and turn it on. If you wish to connect your TV to your desktop computer or your stereo system you might need to get a few more cables, but that is where your troubles end.</p><p> Unfortunately the same cannot be said for 4K projectors because you first need to find the right distance from the projection screen, then you must connect it to a computer or video playback device and finally you need to adjust picture sharpness that is directly related to the distance from the projection screen. In terms of simplicity and the amount of time needed for installation the projector VS 4K TV, dilemma seems to be non-existent</p><h4 id="7-Viewing-experience"><a href="#7-Viewing-experience" class="headerlink" title="7.  Viewing experience"></a>7.  Viewing experience</h4><p> For some people, at least the experience of having a 4K projector in your home may be reminiscent of watching a movie in the theater. Also, the projected images might be lighter on the eyes, but if you are thinking about getting a 4K projector bear in mind that you’ll need additional equipment to have the best possible viewing experience.</p><p> 4K TV’s provide less immersive experience than the 4K projectors, however, with so many models available with the size of more than 60 inches that provide crisp and vivid colors the experience of watching a movie or any other 4K content is nothing short of superb.</p><h4 id="8-Cost"><a href="#8-Cost" class="headerlink" title="8.  Cost"></a>8.  Cost</h4><p> 4K projectors vs 4K TVs comparison is not hard to make when it comes to price because projectors are much more expensive. Even the Full HD, 2K projectors that can play 4K content cost between $3.000 and 5.000$, while home entertainment projectors with native 4K resolution don’t cost less than $10.000.</p><p> 4K TVs are much more affordable since you can purchase a new 60-inch model for approximately $2.000. The image quality of 4K projectors simply doesn’t justify their price.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087484/7443" target="_top" id="2087484">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087484" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087484/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Winner-4K-TV"><a href="#Winner-4K-TV" class="headerlink" title="Winner - 4K TV"></a>Winner - 4K TV</h2><p> The high price, relatively complicated setup, additional equipment that is required for a perfect home entertainment experience make the 4K projection VS 4K TV showdown incredibly unfair because 4K TVs are simply better in each and every of these aspects. Perhaps the best option is to have both a projector and a 4K TV, but if your budget is limited and you can’t spare $3000 or much more for a 4K projector, we suggest that TV is much better option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868586/19272" target="_top" id="1868586">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868586" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868586/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-expert-recommended-5-top-drones-on-market/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Expert-Recommended 5 Top Drones on Market</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-high-fidelity-feat-hero5-black-vs-hero4-silver-edition-battle/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved High-Fidelity Feat Hero5 Black vs Hero4 Silver Edition Battle</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-real-time-voice-to-action-no-price-tag/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Real-Time Voice to Action, No Price Tag</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-audioadvisor-dacast-and-what-it-should-be/"><u>[New] In 2024, AudioAdvisor DaCast & What It Should Be</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-revel-in-photo-excellence-with-this-guide-to-mastering-the-background-erase-tool/"><u>[New] In 2024, Revel in Photo Excellence with This Guide to Mastering the Background Erase Tool</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-kinemasters-journey-for-seamless-scene-transitions-for-2024/"><u>[New] Kinemaster's Journey for Seamless Scene Transitions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-essentials-for-optimal-zoom-use-on-win10-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Essentials for Optimal Zoom Use on WIN10 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-speech-recognition-made-easy-your-route-to-streamlined-workflows-with-microsoft-words-features-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Speech Recognition Made Easy Your Route to Streamlined Workflows with Microsoft Word's Features for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/3-solutions-to-hard-reset-sony-xperia-10-v-phone-using-pc-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>3 Solutions to Hard Reset Sony Xperia 10 V Phone Using PC | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/6-solutions-to-fix-error-505-in-google-play-store-on-infinix-note-30-vip-racing-edition-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>6 Solutions to Fix Error 505 in Google Play Store on Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/download-the-latest-version-of-brother-hl-2240-drivers-for-pcs-running-windows/"><u>Download the Latest Version of Brother HL-2240 Drivers for PCs Running Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/free-brother-mfc-7860dw-printer-drivers-latest-version-available-now/"><u>Free Brother MFC-7860DW Printer Drivers - Latest Version Available Now!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/guide-on-how-to-erase-apple-iphone-15-data-completely-drfone-by-drfone-ios-full-data-eraser-ios-full-data-eraser/"><u>Guide on How To Erase Apple iPhone 15 Data Completely | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-to-get-the-dragon-scale-and-evolution-enabled-pokemon-on-nokia-g310-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to get the dragon scale and evolution-enabled pokemon On Nokia G310?

But the biggest fact to discuss about its video quality is the interpolated 4K offering. In order to update your knowledge about this technology, let us mention that interpolated word expresses the ability to update lower resolution levels with richer pixel density using some advanced processing techniques internally. It means, SJ6 Lengend can itself record 2K videos only but the end results are 4K with added 2K pixels. But, you will be able to adjust with this feature as SJ6 Legend offers incredible results at its 240 fps and 120 fps adjustments at 720p resolution level and the super capacity results at 1080p.</p><p>This action camera offers great footage results in day light; however, you may find little decay in quality at low light conditions. You may find little trouble with its low audio quality but overall service is appreciable.</p><h4 id="Image-Quality"><a href="#Image-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality"></a>Image Quality</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sj6-legend-photo-sample.jpg"                      alt="sj6 legend photo sample"                ></p><p>You will find great color distribution in all SJ6 Legend camera photos with added sharpness in details. Every picture delivers great information but once you enlarge the view or take it out in full size you will notice blurriness in view. Users report impressive results in day light but performance naturally goes down with low light conditions. One more trouble with its 16MP lens resolution is that with long hour usage you may start facing camera freezing issues.</p><h4 id="Image-Stabilization-and-Fisheye-Correction"><a href="#Image-Stabilization-and-Fisheye-Correction" class="headerlink" title="Image Stabilization and Fisheye Correction"></a>Image Stabilization and Fisheye Correction</h4><p>SJ6 Legend is designed to offer great image stabilization service with its advanced Gyro Stabilization system. Even if you start recording videos at a road full of bumps, simply switch to your powerful gyro stabilizer and you will get fine details for whole footage. It can easily minimize the effect of all shaky up and down motions. Most of the users love to use SJ6 cam for their biking adventure as it can record every motion well while staying stick to handlebar or to the helmet.</p><p>One more advantage offered by SJ6 design is its fisheye correction ability. It will never make you feel annoyed with unwanted bends in the image; this feature ensures all fine details with standard focus.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn How to Stabilize Shaky Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="Battery"><a href="#Battery" class="headerlink" title="Battery"></a>Battery</h4><p>SJ6 action camera is equipped with a detachable battery unit that has 1000mAh rating. If you keep your Wi-Fi and screen off during recording process then this battery can serve you for longer duration. The general battery performance reports reveal its ability to record tirelessly up to 70 minutes when camera is switched to 4K resolution with 24fps settings. If you proceed with 2K&#x2F;30fps settings then battery life will be extended up to 72 minutes. In case of 1080p you can enjoy recording up to 65 min and 113 min with 60fps and 30 fps settings respectively. This battery takes maximum 120 minutes to get fully charged.</p><h4 id="Connectivity"><a href="#Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity"></a>Connectivity</h4><p>Those who are planning to use this camera with a drone can take benefit from FPV mode as it offers easy view of all details in front of camera when your drone is in the air. This tiny device also offers Car DVR settings that assist in loop recording while ensuring great control over all movements. You will be glad to know that SJ6 is designed with in-built Wi-Fi arrangement so you can enjoy remote control with its easy connectivity on smartphones.

The LCD panel assists in better control to all camera settings.

Many big messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, Viber, etc., have successfully added this feature to their software. You can mail or send your voice message to another user over a network and may get a reply in the same voicemail form. So, let’s start discussing the <strong>voicemail recorder on iPhone</strong> briefly in the following to help you understand more!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-voicemail"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-voicemail" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is voicemail?"></a>Part 1. What is voicemail?</h2><p>A voicemail is usually an audio form of a message sent by a user digitally over a network to another user on the same network. It is one of the most used types of messaging nowadays. Many people on the internet prefer to send a voicemail instead of a text mail because it seems to be more personal than it. In simple words, a voicemail is a digital audio message sent by or recorded by a user for another user. Also, another definition of it is that voicemail is a computerized system that allows users to easily exchange audio messages among themselves.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-should-people-use-it"><a href="#Part-2-Why-should-people-use-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Why should people use it?"></a>Part 2. Why should people use it?</h2><p>Voicemail is a more convenient way to communicate with someone than text messaging. Moreover, the others can leave a voice message for you when you are offline. Once messages have been placed in the voice mailbox, the owner can be informed through phone or pager. They can also call their own voice mailbox, extract the message, and re-listen before saving, deleting, or other operations at any time. Additionally, voicemail offers the advantages of strong anonymity and is not location- or time-based, so an increasing number of people are using it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/voicemail-recorder-on-iphone-2022-1.jpg"                      alt="voicemail"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139123/17108" target="_top" id="2139123">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139123" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139123/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-activate-or-deactivate-voicemail-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-activate-or-deactivate-voicemail-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Whether a professional or someone looking for a personal adventure video shooting device, GoPro has eased the job for everybody. Off late, Nikon the premier camera-manufacturing brand has introduced a series of Keymission action camera models. Recently, after the release of Keymission 170 (widely in glance for the 170 degree view), with features comparable to the <strong>GoPro Hero 5 Black</strong>, there is much hype among the buyers when making a choice.

GoPro Comparison"></a>Comparative Analysis- Nikon Vs. GoPro Comparison</h4><h4 id="Design-Interface"><a href="#Design-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Design&amp; Interface"></a>Design&amp; Interface</h4><ol><li><strong>Weight &amp; Size</strong><br>The difference of 10g weight is not a big issue while the Nikon camera has larger dimensions. The small GoPro has a cute compact design having an appeal in itself.</li><li><strong>Screen Display</strong><br>Both these cameras have LCD display screen. You can control the menus, live streaming and other functions on the screen. With larger screen space and touch operation, GoPro is easy to handle. Comparing the screen, you will find better resolution, clarity and brighter display on GoPro.</li><li><strong>Interface</strong><br>The <strong>Nikon Keymission 170 action camera</strong> features dual shutters- separate for video and still image capturing allowing lesser adjustments in the settings. Switching between the video and photo modes in GoPro is easy to do via voice commands or the menu.</li></ol><h4 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h4><ol><li><strong>Photo Quality</strong><br>There is a notable difference in the performance of GoPro and Nikon when it comes to taking still images. With 12MP resolution (4000X3000 pixel settings) Hero 5 stands much ahead of Keymission 170 giving you the joy of capturing still photos at the resolution of 8.3MP (3840x2160 pixels). Another important convenience with GoPro is that you can take geo tagged photos besides the choice of shooting WDR and RAW photos. Nikon does not feature GPS configuration. You also cannot take RAW photos with Keymission 170.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/hero5-balck-keymission170-test1.jpg"                      alt="hero5 balck keymission170 test"                ></li><li><strong>Video Quality</strong><br>The video quality output of these cameras is the real point of attraction for all buyers. To all your relaxation, both of them can capture 4K30 (highest resolution) videos. Luckily, the quality of the videos is almost the same.Using the Protune settings on GoPro, you can get better results with sharpening, change ISO limits, take RAW videos with preferred audio settings, adjust the white balance etc. The first time users can use the default settings to capture good high-resolution videos. Keymission allows some limited adjustments with the Pro settings. You can obtain improved video quality by changing the white balance, exposure compensation and other details.<br><strong>You may also like:</strong><br><a class="link"   href="https://www.filmstocks.com/effects-store-upgrade.html" >Get Cool After Effects for Your Video&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br>Video Modes<br>When it comes to considering the availability of the video modes, the GoPro Hero 5 Black is the ultimate winner. You can get a range of video modes on this camera with varied pixels and fps combinations. The Keymission offers fewer choices to set the video capturing modes.<br>The GoPro works fine for the professionals looking to capture industry standard videos at 4K resolution.At normal speed, you can choose to set video modes at maximum of 2160p shooting at 30 or 25 fps. You can adjust the frame rate from 25 fps to 60fps while shooting at 1080 pixel resolution. These adjustments are sufficient if you are a beginner and want to get handy with action cameras.<br>Field of View (FOV)<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/hero5-black-keymission170-fov.jpg"                      alt="hero5 balck keymission170 fov"                ><br>As the name suggests, the Keymission 170 only offers the standard view of 170 degrees only. The degree is reduced a bit less when you are using the image stabilization feature. With flexible frame rate adjustments and resolution, you can use several FOV options including superview, wide, linear, medium, narrow etc. with GoPro Hero 5 Balck.<br>Stabilization<br>The video stabilization in Nikon Keymission 170 action camera is more advanced especially when you are using the external Gyrostabilizer.<br>White Balance<br>Nikon Keymission gives you an amazing feel with the yellowish orange effect when using the default white balance. This is much enhanced compared to that on the GoPro Hero 5 black. GoPro supports automatic white balance adjustment according to the ambiance and lights. While this feature is very advanced in the latest, model but not as that of the Nikon effect.<br>Low Light Video Capturing<br>There are shortcomings with both these cameras when you are shooting under low light availability. Yet, GoPro is a bit advanced to give you good video quality under low light. With Nikon it is preferable to use extra lights if you desire to get bright sharp objects.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/hero5-balck-keymission170-low-light-test.jpg"                      alt="hero5 balck keymission170 low light test"                ></li><li><strong>Audio Quality</strong><br>The Hero 5 Black is very tactically designed with dual microphones – at the rear and front ends. The camera can auto switch microphone during video capturing based on the requirements. To give you better sound quality, the camera swaps to the back microphone during heavy disturbing noise coming from the front direction like biking under heavy wind speed. The <strong>Nikon Keymission 170 action camera</strong> has built in stereo microphone to produce medium quality satisfactory sound capturing.</li></ol><h4 id="Features"><a href="#Features" class="headerlink" title="Features"></a>Features</h4><ol><li><strong>Waterproof&#x2F; Dust-Proof&#x2F;Freeze-Proof&#x2F;Shockproof</strong><br>Both of these are waterproof cameras and safe to use underwater at a depth of 10m. If you are going beyond 10m, the GoPro housing gives you the convenience to travel up to 60m deep while Nikon housing gives protection at depths up to 40m only.<br>As far as the other protection features are concerned, GoPro lacks dust resistance, freezer sustenance and shockproof protection. The <strong>Nikon Keymission 170 action camera</strong> with 2m shockproof protection can sustain knocks, shakes, jerks and bumps to some extent. Perfect for freezing points up to -10C&#x2F;14F, the camera is your best friend while skiing, snowboarding, snorkeling and going underwater in cold weather.</li><li><strong>Battery &amp; Memory</strong><br>Both these cameras function on lithium ion batteries (provided with the camera). <strong>GoPro Hero 5 Black</strong> offers improved battery version allowing you to shoot 4k @ 24 fps videos for 2 hours. With the same settings, the Nikon battery will last for an hour of shooting.<br>On the memory card storage, Nikon rules indispensably. The double storage capacity of 128GB, the device works perfect while shooting 4K videos. You can store the entire stuff for over days of shooting. Even with the 64GB storage, GoPro can give you convenient space to store large standard video projects. However, you can change cards and later merge them during editing</li><li><strong>Wi-Fi &amp; App</strong><br>Wi-Fi &amp; Bluetooth<br>Both these cameras allow connectivity via Bluetooth and Wifi. The Wifi functions superbly to support live video streaming, photo capturing with apps etc.<br>App<br>Both Hero 5 Black and Keymission 170 allow app access on Android and iOS platforms. The Nikon’s SnapBridge app poses bug issues blocking seamless operation. As compared to this, the GoPro has a series of mobile apps you can use as per requirement. Apps like Capture, Quik and others make your camera operation easy. However, some of them may have error problems. It is better to choose in context to user ratings.</li></ol><h4 id="GoPro-Hero-5-Black-or-Nikon-Keymission-170-Which-is-the-Best-Buy-Action-Camera"><a href="#GoPro-Hero-5-Black-or-Nikon-Keymission-170-Which-is-the-Best-Buy-Action-Camera" class="headerlink" title="GoPro Hero 5 Black or Nikon Keymission 170- Which is the Best Buy Action Camera"></a>GoPro Hero 5 Black or Nikon Keymission 170- Which is the Best Buy Action Camera</h4><p>As with the pricing, both these cameras are available at almost the same range. As far as the Nikon vs. GoPro comparison on technological specifications are concerned, it is obvious that the Keymission 170 is a bit lacking in advancement. The model is somewhat near to the earlier GoPro Hero Session model priced at $199. With the same perfection and some extra detailing, Nikon at $399.99 is not worth any match for the <strong>GoPro Hero 5 Black.</strong></p><h4 id="Recommend-best-video-editing-software-for-action-camera-users"><a href="#Recommend-best-video-editing-software-for-action-camera-users" class="headerlink" title="Recommend best video editing software for action camera users"></a><strong>Recommend best video editing software for action camera users</strong></h4><p>If you want to take your video content to the next level with some video editing without being completely overwhelmed, you will definitely want to give <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (originally Wondershare Video Editor) a try.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Light-Shadow-Subtlety-in-Film-Coloring"><a href="#Light-Shadow-Subtlety-in-Film-Coloring" class="headerlink" title="Light, Shadow &amp; Subtlety in Film Coloring"></a>Light, Shadow &amp; Subtlety in Film Coloring</h2><p>Everyone in the video editing world is full of lively and beautiful colors — just like the world we live in every day. But, if you’ve ever shot any film on a smartphone or a digital camera, you’ve probably observed the colors you see in real life don’t always match up to what you want to see on your screen. In this article, you will grasp how and when to use the color grading process by stylizing the color scheme of your footage and its importance in your everyday film and video projects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-panel-filmora.jpg"                      alt="color grading panel filmora"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-is-Color-Grading"><a href="#What-is-Color-Grading" class="headerlink" title="What is Color Grading?"></a>What is Color Grading?</h2><p>Color grading is the video editing process wherein grading (arranging) colors in a video or film to give them a stylistic look. It is different from Color correction because color correction is the process of correcting (fixing) colors in a video or a film as a way to get them back to what they should look like for your project or output.</p><p>In cinematography, color grading refers to the manipulation of film and video images to create consistent color tones throughout a motion picture. Many filmmakers use a color palette or preset as part of their overall production plan. These palettes represent artistic choices that provide the film with a cohesive general aspect. When film footage does not adequately match these color palettes, directors and colorists use digital color grading tools to change video colors as needed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/origianl-video-color-grading.jpg"                      alt="origianl video color grading"                ></p><p>Color grading and color correction are processes that happen throughout postproduction. One makes the film look more native, and the other stylizes the footage. After the colorist finishes color correction, they can begin grading the film. During color grading, colorists use editing software to formalize the footage, highlighting a movie’s visual tone and ambiance and making it look more cinematic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/apply-color-grading-to-video.jpg"                      alt="apply color grading to video"                ></p><p>To summarize, Color grading can be used to make both technical and creative changes. Colorists use color grading for artistic purposes to ensure that the film’s carefully curated color palette conveys a specific atmosphere, style, or emotion.</p><h2 id="Why-is-Color-Grading-Important"><a href="#Why-is-Color-Grading-Important" class="headerlink" title="Why is Color Grading Important?"></a>Why is Color Grading Important?</h2><p><strong>Color grading establish a picture’s first impression</strong></p><p>Most images are initially seen as rushed by in one of the infinite scrolls that fill social media or in small thumbnails in galleries. In these circumstances, perfect skin retouching or flawless exposure means very little. Users do not even recognize the image in enough detail with these varieties of an object. Color grading, however, stands out within the condition of these formats. An excellent color-graded image that implores the viewer will drive them to stop and take a closer look. As a photographer, you need support in learning how to grade your ideas so that they will grab viewers’ attention in a fleeting second among the chaotic noise of the digital age.</p><p><strong>It communicates the atmosphere to tune with the scene</strong></p><p>The communication of emotion and story through the lens is one of the most powerful tools a photographer has at their disposal. The grading of a well-graded image can often augment the sense of story within a scene or even completely transform it. Without the grading, an image may look flat, boring, or even disjointed. As a photographer becomes more proficient at grading, he or she can leverage the power of color tone to influence emotional tone within a scene. Grading at this level can transform an unexciting frame into a moment of cinematic magic.</p><p><strong>Color grading encourage a style that can be completely your own</strong></p><p>One of the most intimidating challenges a photographer or vlogger faces is creating a unique style that can result in a brand for their work. Making a visual style that viewers can recognize at a glance can tremendously impact the growth of a photographer’s career. Color grading plays a vital part in that process. Customers will often come to you with a wide range of different photography outputs. By defining a consistent color grading work, you can tie it all into a dense brand that reflects strongly on you and construct a distinctive value that provides you something to sell that only you can offer to people.</p><h2 id="How-to-use-Color-Grading-in-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-use-Color-Grading-in-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to use Color Grading in Wondershare Filmora?"></a>How to use Color Grading in Wondershare Filmora?</h2><p>There are many color grading software available on your Windows PC or Mac.

By modifying this setting, control the dissimilarity in color and brightness in contrary parts of the video image.</p><p><strong>Saturation:</strong> This setting constitutes the amount of gray in proportion to the hue. You can adjust it to make the entire video image’s colors look soaked or unnoticeable.</p><p><strong>Brightness:</strong> You can change this setting to reorganize your video image’s overall lightness or darkness.</p><p><strong>Tint:</strong> Tint cites the light of a color. For example, when rede is saturated with white, it will create a shade of pink.</p><p><strong>3D LUT:</strong> The 3D Lookup Tables in Filmora allow you to employ Hollywood film-looking color sets for your video.</p><p><strong>Using the Advanced Color Tools</strong></p><h5 id="Step1Choose-The-Color-correction"><a href="#Step1Choose-The-Color-correction" class="headerlink" title="Step1Choose The Color correction"></a>Step1Choose The Color correction</h5><p>Here, there are two options to select: The Color correction.

This reflects the exact allotment of colors throughout a specific image, highlighting the various colors on the screen and the pixels for every color type. When the color histogram points out as “Three Color Histograms,” a specific assignment of the three primary colors (R, B, and G) is reflected.</p><p><strong>White balance</strong></p><p>You can modify the white balance of this video clip here. This allows you to change how intense each color appears in the video. This is important since white balance enables you to depict images realistically. According to the different intensities of the colors, you can get a much-differentiated outcome in terms of realism.</p><p><strong>Vignette</strong></p><p>It is a French word that initially meant the borders of a book. This process allows the center of the image to appear clear and the edges much fader. In other words, if you wish to focus on the middle of the video and blur the rest, you will need this effect. In this way, you can emphasize what is essential and let the other details disappear into the background.</p><p><strong>Color and light</strong></p><p>In the Color and Light section, you can adjust the Exposure, Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, Vibrance, Highlights, Shadows, Whites, and Blacks.</p><p><strong>3D Look Up Table</strong></p><p>3D LUT is part of the digital middle process. They are mainly used for you to compute how the video will be displayed on various screens and devices. The color space is precisely calculated and mapped to be projected precisely as you would desire. There are, of course, a lot of 3 Dimensional effects allowing you to transform the image of your video as promised.</p><p><strong>HSL</strong></p><p>HSL is the acronym for hue, saturation, and luminosity. It is cylindrical geometry, where you mix the different colors and adjust their intensities to get the accurate mix you are eyeing for in your video. You can select whether you want the video to arise lighter or darker, getting the right mix of colors every time.</p><p>In the HSL section, you can enhance the corresponding color in the video.</p><h5 id="Step3Save-and-export-your-work"><a href="#Step3Save-and-export-your-work" class="headerlink" title="Step3Save and export your work"></a>Step3Save and export your work</h5><p>To view the output, you can compare the video before and after color grading in the A&#x2F;B comparison view. You can eventually save the color grading setting created as a preset and utilize it. If the result is good, click the Export button to upload it to YouTube or Vimeo, Save it as MP4, MKV, WMV, etc., or burn it into DVD.</p><p>Tips: To enter the Advance Color Correction setting, you can select the clip in the timeline and click the Color Tuning icon in the toolbar.</p><p>I hope the mentioned information helps you understand the distinction between Color correction and color grading and creating stunning, excellent videos in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with the Color Tuning tools.</p><p>Overall, Color grading is the process of video editing to have an excellent look to help make a video feel more vigorous and stylistic and can define color assessment. Color correcting is the process of editing a video or film to fix any variances in the color so it can display how the viewers are meant to see it.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p></article[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)For macOS 10.14 or later<p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-geeky-gatherings-best-general-trivia-streams/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Geeky Gatherings Best General Trivia Streams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-primeplay-videoapp-inspection-for-2024/"><u>[New] PrimePlay VideoApp Inspection for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-scouting-for-subtle-sophisticated-and-spare-tiktok-screenshots-for-2024/"><u>[New] Scouting for Subtle, Sophisticated, and Spare TikTok Screenshots for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-melodies-with-a-twist-funny-tone-websites-listed/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Melodies with a Twist Funny Tone Websites Listed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-complete-windows-10-know-how-reference/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved The Complete WINDOWS 10 Know-How Reference</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-action-cameras-clash-gopro-hero5-black-against-yi-4k-update/"><u>[Updated] Action Cameras Clash GoPro Hero5 Black Against Yi 4K Update</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-a-simple-tutorial-starting-screen-recording-on-mac/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, A Simple Tutorial Starting Screen Recording on Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-videoshow-app-a-complete-guide-for-24-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Mastering VideoShow App - A Complete Guide for '24 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/ai-allies-in-your-quest-implementing-chatgpt-to-enrich-your-dandd-worlds/"><u>AI Allies in Your Quest: Implementing ChatGPT to Enrich Your D&D Worlds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/asus-proart-pa-329q-professional-4k-monitor-review/"><u>Asus ProArt PA 329Q Professional 4K Monitor Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/1723006703504-epic-games-launcher-issues-here-are-quick-solutions-for-it-refusing-to-open/"><u>Epic Games Launcher Issues?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Voice-Transformation-Tools-Magic-Edition-Highlighted"><a href="#Voice-Transformation-Tools-Magic-Edition-Highlighted" class="headerlink" title="Voice Transformation Tools: Magic Edition Highlighted"></a>Voice Transformation Tools: Magic Edition Highlighted</h2><p>The <strong>Magic Call voice changer app</strong> is a mobile app that can make prank calls by changing your voice into male, female, cartoon, and more. In addition, the <strong>Magic Call app</strong> allows you to customize the background of your calls with sound effects like rain, traffic, music concert, rain, and more. Just select a contact and start your Magic Call. But as good as it comes, many users complain that Magic Call doesn’t work as intended. Is that true? We dive into the app to bring you this first-hand experience.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try AI Voice Changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try AI Voice Changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-the-Magic-Call-app-really-working"><a href="#Part-1-Is-the-Magic-Call-app-really-working" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is the Magic Call app really working?"></a>Part 1: Is the Magic Call app really working?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/magic-call-voice-changer-app-1.jpg"                      alt="magic call voice changer app on app store"                ></p><p>So, does <a class="link"   href="http://www.magiccall.co/" >Magic Call <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> work, or is it just another over-hyped app on Play Store and App Store? For starters, the fact that the app is on Play Store and App Store means it has been tested to ensure users have a trusted experience. However, you’ll notice that the app is rated 2.3 stars on Play Store, which is far from reassuring.</p><p>Some reviewers often complain that Magic Call doesn’t run properly. For example, one review claims the app hangs for at least an hour after clicking the “Continue” button. Another common problem with Magic Call is the failure to send the OTS SMS to the number you provide. Some reviewers also claim that the app doesn’t send fake calls, although they can hear their phone ringing.</p><p>In our first-hand review of the app, we noticed that the app couldn’t send an OTP to our phone number. However, we contacted their support, and this was sorted out almost instantly. Besides that, the app works fine, although with limited choices of voice effects.

Final Cut Pro is one of the most popular paid video editors that professional video creators recommend. Final Cut Pro is a paid software and you have to pay a hefty one-time fee for lifetime full access. Therefore, it is important that you know everything about Final Cut Pro before purchasing it.</p><p>We have done a complete review of Apple Final Cut Pro. We have stated the key features, pricing details as well as overall performance. Along with these parameters, we have highlighted the pros and cons of Final Cut Pro. Thereafter, you can check out our tutorial on how to edit a video on Final Cut Pro. Finally, we have provided a better alternative to Final Cut Pro if you are not satisfied with FCP.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-History-of-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#1-History-of-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1. History of Final Cut Pro"></a>1. History of Final Cut Pro</h2><p>The journey of Final Cut Pro(FCP) began as an alternative to Adobe Premiere Pro. FCP was initially developed by Macromedia. The designer of FCP named Randy Ubillos used to work for Adobe Premiere previously. In 1998, Apple purchased the development team of Final Cut Pro. Hence, Macromedia FCP turned into Apple FCP.</p><p>The popularity of Final Cut Pro started to pick up in the early 2000s. A popular movie producer named Michael Bloom praised FCP to boost its popularity. The software did not crash even once during rendering a movie. Soon, the popular director Roger Avery became the spokesperson for Apple FCP. This encouraged video creators and producers to try out Final Cut Pro as a video editor.</p><p>The breakthrough came in 2002 when Final Cut Pro was awarded a Primetime Emmy Engineering Award. Final Cut Express was launched in 2003 at an affordable rate. But it was discontinued in 2011. This is because Apple launched Final Cut Pro X in April 2011.</p><p>Final Cut Pro X came with a new user interface and workflow. It was packed with loads of new features. Subsequently, new features such as effects, filters, color enhancement, and support for HDR and 360-degree video were introduced. This helped it to become one of the best video editors in the world.</p><h2 id="2-Features-of-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#2-Features-of-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="2. Features of Final Cut Pro"></a>2. Features of Final Cut Pro</h2><p>Final Cut Pro is a feature-rich video editor. Starting from basic features for regular video editing to advanced tools for professional video editing, you get everything in one software. Here are the key features of Final Cut Pro by Apple that you should know.</p><p>Video Cut: You have to deal with multiple video clips for one video project. Naturally, you have to cut and trim video clips and edit them before joining them. Final Cut Pro comes with a state-of-the-art set of trimming tools. Starting from ripple edit and roll edit to slide and slip edit, you can use these techniques comfortably.</p><p><strong>Title and Caption:</strong> Texts are an important part of every video. There is no doubt that a great text effect and a stunning text animation take video to the next level. Final Cut Pro has loads of text effects and presets that you can apply to enhance titles and captions. Starting from opening and ending crediting to lower-thirds and subtitles, there are presets for everything.</p><p><strong>Transitions</strong>: Transitions are an integral part of video editing. Whenever there is a change of scenes, there has to be a transition effect. A transition prevents jump cuts and awkward scene shifting. Final Cut Pro has a wide range of transitions that will enhance your video content.</p><p><strong>Video Effects</strong>: There are over 300 video effects in Final Cut Pro. The more the video effects, the more popular the video editor becomes. But there is no point in having loads of video effects unless they can impactful. Final Cut Pro stands out for its video effects and animations and you can customize them as per your requirements.</p><p><strong>Chroma Key</strong>: You see the use of green screen background in movies and films. Final Cut Pro supports the Chroma key by which you can remove the green screen background. You can replace it with anything starting from static background to dynamic background. Besides, you can add effects and animations to make it dramatic and cinematic.</p><p><strong>Audio Editing</strong>: Last but not least, the audio part of a video is extremely important. Starting from dialogs to background music, everything enhances the video content. Final Cut Pro has a dedicated audio editor where you can edit audio clips as good as video clips. You can also separate sound clips into different audio lanes.</p><h2 id="3-Price-Choices-of-FCP"><a href="#3-Price-Choices-of-FCP" class="headerlink" title="3. Price Choices of FCP"></a>3. Price Choices of FCP</h2><p>Most premium video editors charge monthly, quarterly, or annual subscription fees. But Final Cut Pro does not have any subscription-based pricing model. It charges a one-time fee for lifetime full access. The one-time fee is $299.99 and there are no additional charges for future updates.</p><p>The one-time fee may seem massive but if you use FCP for a few years, it will become rather economical. For a professional video editor who prefers FCP over others, the one-time fee is the most economical price model. You can try out its free trial version for 90 days to understand if FCP is meant for you.</p><h2 id="4-Performance"><a href="#4-Performance" class="headerlink" title="4. Performance"></a>4. Performance</h2><p>FCP is simply a powerful video editor when you compare it with other premium video editors.

How to Edit Video with Final Cut Pro</p><p>Now that we have reviewed Final Cut Pro thoroughly, it is time to illustrate how to use Final Cut Pro. The learning curve of Final Ct Pro is steep and the user interface is not highly intuitive. That is why you need to go through tutorials to get the steps correct for the video editor. Here are the steps on how to edit a video with Final Cut X.</p><p>Step 1: Download and install Final Cut Pro. Launch the application and you will be asked for certain permissions. Allow them to open Final Cut Pro for the first time.</p><p>Step 2: Go to File&gt; New&gt; Project. Name your project and select Use Automatic Settings to get started. Go to File&gt; Import&gt; Media and bring in the video clips that you want to edit. You will see the thumbnails of the imported video clips under the Browser of FCP.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-media-file-into-fcp.jpg"                      alt="import media into fcp"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151873/7443" target="_top" id="2151873">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151873" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151873/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 3: Drag any video clip from the Browser to the Timeline.
